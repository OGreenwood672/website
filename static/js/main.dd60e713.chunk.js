few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.\n\n"Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"\n\nThe undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.\n\n"Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."\nThe fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.\n\nThe voice spoke again.\n\n"I can\'t hardly move with all these creeper things."\n\nThe owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.\n\n"Where\'s the man with the megaphone?"\n\nThe fair boy shook his head.\n\n"This is an island. At least I think it\'s an island. That\'s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren\'t any grownups anywhere."\n\nThe fat boy looked startled.\n\n"There was that pilot. But he wasn\'t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."\n\n\nThe fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.\n\n"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn\'t they?"\n\nThe fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.\n\n"Aren\'t there any grownups at all?"\n\n"I don\'t think so."\n\nThe fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.\n\n"No grownups!"\n\nThe fat boy thought for a moment.\n\n"That pilot."\n\nThe fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth.\n\n"He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn\'t land here. Not in a place with wheels."\n\n"We was attacked!"\n\n"He\'ll be back all right."\nThe fat boy shook his head.\n\n"When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it."\n\nHe looked up and down the scar.\n\n"And this is what the cabin done."\n\nThe fair boy reached out and touched the jagged end of a trunk. For a moment he looked interested.\n\n"What happened to it?" he asked. "Where\'s it got to now?"\n\n"That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn\'t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling. There must have been some kids still in it."\n\nHe hesitated for a moment, then spoke again.\n\n"What\'s your name?"\n\n"Ralph."\n\nThe fat boy waited to be asked his name in turn but this proffer of acquaintance was not made; the fair boy called Ralph smiled vaguely, stood up, and began to make his way once more toward the lagoon. The fat boy hung steadily at his shoulder.\n\n"I expect there\'s a lot more of us scattered about. You haven\'t seen any others, have you?"\n\nRalph shook his head and increased his speed. Then he tripped over a branch and came down with a crash.\n\n\nThe fat boy stood by him, breathing hard.\n\n"My auntie told me not to run," he explained, "on account of my asthma."\n\n"Ass-mar?"\n\n"That\'s right. Can\'t catch my breath. I was the only boy in our school what had asthma," said the fat boy with a touch of pride. "And I\'ve been wearing specs since I was three."\n\nHe took off his glasses and held them out to Ralph, blinking and smiling, and then started to wipe them against his grubby wind-breaker. An expression of pain and inward concentration altered the pale contours of his face. He smeared the sweat from his cheeks and quickly adjusted the spectacles on his nose.\n\n"Them fruit."\n\nHe glanced round the scar.\n\n"Them fruit," he said, "I expect--"\n\nHe put on his glasses, waded away from Ralph, and crouched down among the tangled foliage.\n\n"I\'ll be out again in just a minute--"\n\nRalph disentangled himself cautiously and stole away through the branches. In a few seconds the fat boy\'s grunts were behind him and he was hurrying toward the screen that still lay between him and the lagoon. He climbed over a broken trunk and was out of the jungle.\n\nThe shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar. Ralph stood, one hand against a grey trunk, and screwed up his eyes against the shimmering water. Out there, perhaps a mile away, the white surf flinked on a coral reef, and beyond that the open sea was dark blue. Within the irregular arc of coral the lagoon was still as a mountain lake--blue of all shades and shadowy green and purple. The beach between the palm terrace and the water was a thin stick, endless apparently, for to Ralph\'s left the perspectives of palm and beach and water drew to a point at infinity; and always, almost visible, was the heat.\n\nHe jumped down from the terrace. The sand was thick over his black shoes and the heat hit him. He became conscious of the weight of clothes, kicked his shoes off fiercely and ripped off each stocking with its elastic garter in a single movement. Then he leapt back on the terrace, pulled off his shirt, and stood there among the skull-like coconuts with green shadows from the palms and the forest sliding over his skin. He undid the snake-clasp of his belt, lugged off his shorts and pants, and stood there naked, looking at the dazzling beach and the water.\n\nHe was old enough, twelve years and a few months, to have lost the prominent tummy of childhood and not yet old enough for adolescence to have made him awkward. You could see now that he might make a boxer, as far as width and heaviness of shoulders went, but there was a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil. He patted the palm trunk softly, and, forced at last to believe in the reality of the island laughed delightedly again and stood on his head. He turned neatly on to his feet, jumped down to the beach, knelt and swept a double armful of sand into a pile against his chest. Then he sat back and looked at the water with bright, excited eyes.\n\n"Ralph--"\n\nThe fat boy lowered himself over the terrace and sat down carefully, using the edge as a seat.\n\n"I\'m sorry I been such a time. Them fruit--"\n\nHe wiped his glasses and adjusted them on his button nose. The frame had made a deep, pink "V" on the bridge. He looked critically at Ralph\'s golden body and then down at his own clothes. He laid a hand on the end of a zipper that extended down his chest.\n\n"My auntie--"\n\nThen he opened the zipper with decision and pulled the whole wind-breaker over his head.\n\n"There!"\n\nRalph looked at him sidelong and said nothing.\n\n"I expect we\'ll want to know all their names," said the fat boy, "and make a list. We ought to have a meeting."\n\nRalph did not take the hint so the fat boy was forced to continue.\n\n"I don\'t care what they call me," he said confidentially, "so long as they don\'t call me what they used to call me at school."\n\nRalph was faintly interested.\n\n"What was that?"\n\nThe fat boy glanced over his shoulder, then leaned toward Ralph. He whispered.\n\n"They used to call me \'Piggy.\'"\n\nRalph shrieked with laughter. He jumped up.\n\n"Piggy! Piggy!"\n\n"Ralph--please!"\n\nPiggy clasped his hands in apprehension.\n\n"I said I didn\'t want--"\n\n"Piggy! Piggy!"\n\nRalph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.\n\n"Sche-aa-ow!"\n\nHe dived in the sand at Piggy\'s feet and lay there laughing.\n\n"Piggy!"\n\nPiggy grinned reluctantly, pleased despite himself at even this much recognition.\n\n"So long as you don\'t tell the others--"\n\nRalph giggled into the sand. The expression of pain and concentration returned to Piggy\'s face.\n\n"Half a sec\'."\n\nHe hastened back into the forest. Ralph stood up and trotted along to the right.\n\nHere the beach was interrupted abruptly by the square motif of the landscape; a great platform of pink granite thrust up uncompromisingly through forest and terrace and sand and lagoon to make a raised jetty four feet high. The top of this was covered with a thin layer of soil and coarse grass and shaded with young palm trees. There was not enough soil for them to grow to any height and when they reached perhaps twenty feet they fell and dried, forming a criss-cross pattern of trunks, very convenient to sit on. The palms that still stood made a green roof, covered on the underside with a quivering tangle of reflections from the lagoon. Ralph hauled himself onto this platform, noted the coolness and shade, shut one eye, and decided that the shadows on his body were really green. He picked his way to the seaward edge of the platform and stood looking down into the water. It was clear to the bottom and bright with the efflorescence of tropical weed and coral. A school of tiny, glittering fish flicked hither and thither. Ralph spoke to himself, sounding the bass strings of delight.\n\n"Whizzoh!"\n\nBeyond the platform there was more enchantment. Some act of God--a typhoon perhaps, or the storm that had accompanied his own arrival--had banked sand inside the lagoon so that there was a long, deep pool in the beach with a high ledge of pink granite at the further end. Ralph had been deceived before now by the specious appearance of depth in a beach pool and he approached this one preparing to be disappointed. But the island ran true to form and the incredible pool, which clearly was only invaded by the sea at high tide, was so deep at one end as to be dark green. Ralph inspected the whole thirty yards carefully and then plunged in. The water was warmer than his blood and he might have been swimming in a huge bath.\n\nPiggy appeared again, sat on the rocky ledge, and watched Ralph\'s green and white body enviously.\n\n"You can\'t half swim."\n\n"Piggy."\n\nPiggy took off his shoes and socks, ranged them carefully on the ledge, and tested the water with one toe.\n\n"It\'s hot!"\n\n"What did you expect?"\n\n"I didn\'t expect nothing. My auntie--"\n\n"Sucks to your auntie!"\n\nRalph did a surface dive and swam under water with his eyes open; the sandy edge of the pool loomed up like a hillside. He turned over, holding his nose, and a golden light danced and shattered just over his face. Piggy was looking determined and began to take off his shorts. Presently he was palely and fatly naked. He tiptoed down the sandy side of the pool, and sat there up to his neck in water smiling proudly at Ralph.\n"Aren\'t you going to swim?"\n\nPiggy shook his head.\n\n"I can\'t swim. I wasn\'t allowed. My asthma--"\n\n"Sucks to your ass-mar!"\n\nPiggy bore this with a sort of humble patience. "You can\'t half swim well."\n\nRalph paddled backwards down the slope, immersed his mouth and blew a jet of water into the air. Then he lifted his chin and spoke.\n\n"I could swim when I was five. Daddy taught me. He\'s a commander in the Navy. When he gets leave he\'ll come and rescue us. What\'s your father?"\n\nPiggy flushed suddenly.\n\n"My dad\'s dead," he said quickly, "and my mum--"\n\nHe took off his glasses and looked vainly for something with which to clean them.\n\n"I used to live with my auntie. She kept a candy store. I used to get ever so many candies. As many as I liked. When\'ll your dad rescue us?"\n"Soon as he can."\n\nPiggy rose dripping from the water and stood naked, cleaning his glasses with a sock. The only sound that reached them now through the heat of the morning was the long, grinding roar of the breakers on the reef.\n\n"How does he know we\'re here?"\n\nRalph lolled in the water. Sleep enveloped him like the swathing mirages that were wrestling with the brilliance of the lagoon.\n\n"How does he know we\'re here?"\n\nBecause, thought Ralph, because, because. The roar from the reef became very distant.\n\n"They\'d tell him at the airport."\n\nPiggy shook his head, put on his flashing glasses and looked down at Ralph.\n\n"Not them. Didn\'t you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They\'re all dead."\n\nRalph pulled himself out of the water, stood facing Piggy, and considered this unusual problem.\n\nPiggy persisted.\n\n"This an island, isn\'t it?"\n\n"I climbed a rock," said Ralph slowly, "and I think this is an island."\n\n"They\'re all dead," said Piggy, "an\' this is an island. Nobody don\'t know we\'re here. Your dad don\'t know, nobody don\'t know--"\nHis lips quivered and the spectacles were dimmed with mist.\n\n"We may stay here till we die."\n\nWith that word the heat seemed to increase till it became a threatening weight and the lagoon attacked them with a blinding effulgence.\n\n"Get my clothes," muttered Ralph. "Along there."\n\nHe trotted through the sand, enduring the sun\'s enmity, crossed the platform and found his scattered clothes. To put on a grey shirt once more was strangely pleasing. Then he climbed the edge of the platform and sat in the green shade on a convenient trunk. Piggy hauled himself up, carrying most of his clothes under his arms. Then he sat carefully on a fallen trunk near the little cliff that fronted the lagoon; and the tangled reflections quivered over him.\n\nPresently he spoke.\n\n"We got to find the others. We got to do something."\n\nRalph said nothing. Here was a coral island. Protected from the sun, ignoring Piggy\'s ill-omened talk, he dreamed pleasantly.\n\nPiggy insisted.\n\n"How many of us are there?"\n\nRalph came forward and stood by Piggy.\n\n"I don\'t know."\n\nHere and there, little breezes crept over the polished waters beneath the haze of heat. When these breezes reached the platform the palm fronds would whisper, so that spots of blurred sunlight slid over their bodies or moved like bright, winged things in the shade.\nPiggy looked up at Ralph. All the shadows on Ralph\'s face were reversed; green above, bright below from the lagoon. A blur of sunlight was crawling across his hair.\n\n"We got to do something."\n\nRalph looked through him. Here at last was the imagined but never fully realized place leaping into real life. Ralph\'s lips parted in a delighted smile and Piggy, taking this smile to himself as a mark of recognition, laughed with pleasure.\n\n"If it really is an island--"\n\n"What\'s that?"\n\nRalph had stopped smiling and was pointing into the lagoon. Something creamy lay among the ferny weeds.\n\n"A stone."\n\n"No. A shell."\n\nSuddenly Piggy was a-bubble with decorous excitement.\n\n"S\'right. It\'s a shell! I seen one like that before. On someone\'s back wall. A conch he called it. He used to blow it and then his mum would come. It\'s ever so valuable--"\n\nNear to Ralph\'s elbow a palm sapling leaned out over the lagoon. Indeed, the weight was already pulling a lump from the poor soil and soon it would fall. He tore out the stem and began to poke about in the water, while the brilliant fish flicked away on this side and that. Piggy leaned dangerously.\n\n"Careful! You\'ll break it--"\n\n"Shut up."\n\nRalph spoke absently. The shell was interesting and pretty and a worthy plaything; but the vivid phantoms of his day-dream still interposed between him and Piggy, who in this context was an irrelevance. The palm sapling, bending, pushed the shell across the weeds. Ralph used one hand as a fulcrum and pressed down with the other till the shell rose, dripping, and Piggy could make a grab.\nNow the shell was no longer a thing seen but not to be touched, Ralph too became excited. Piggy babbled:\n\n"--a conch; ever so expensive. I bet if you wanted to buy one, you\'d have to pay pounds and pounds and pounds--he had it on his garden wall, and my auntie--"\n\nRalph took the shell from Piggy and a little water ran down his arm. In color the shell was deep cream, touched here and there with fading pink. Between the point, worn away into a little hole, and the pink lips of the mouth, lay eighteen inches of shell with a slight spiral twist and covered with a delicate, embossed pattern. Ralph shook sand out of the deep tube.\n\n"--mooed like a cow," he said. "He had some white stones too, an\' a bird cage with a green parrot. He didn\'t blow the white stones, of course, an\' he said--"\n\nPiggy paused for breath and stroked the glistening thing that lay in Ralph\'s hands.\n\n"Ralph!"\n\nRalph looked up.\n\n"We can use this to call the others. Have a meeting. They\'ll come when they hear us--"\n\nHe beamed at Ralph.\n\n"That was what you meant, didn\'t you? That\'s why you got the conch out of the water?"\n\nRalph pushed back his fair hair.\n\n"How did your friend blow the conch?"\n\n"He kind of spat," said Piggy. "My auntie wouldn\'t let me blow on account of my asthma. He said you blew from down here." Piggy laid a hand on his jutting abdomen. "You try, Ralph. You\'ll call the others."\nDoubtfully, Ralph laid the small end of the shell against his mouth and blew. There came a rushing sound from its mouth but nothing more. Ralph wiped the salt water off his lips and tried again, but the shell remained silent.\n\n"He kind of spat."\n\nRalph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emitted a low, farting noise. This amused both boys so much that Ralph went on squirting for some minutes, between bouts of laughter.\n\n"He blew from down here."\n\nRalph grasped the idea and hit the shell with air from his diaphragm. Immediately the thing sounded. A deep, harsh note boomed under the palms, spread through the intricacies of the forest and echoed back from the pink granite of the mountain. Clouds of birds rose from the treetops, and something squealed and ran in the undergrowth.\n\nRalph took the shell away from his lips.\n\n"Gosh!"\n\nHis ordinary voice sounded like a whisper after the harsh note of the conch. He laid the conch against his lips, took a deep breath and blew once more. The note boomed again: and then at his firmer pressure, the note, fluking up an octave, became a strident blare more penetrating than before. Piggy was shouting something, his face pleased, his glasses flashing. The birds cried, small animals scuttered. Ralph\'s breath failed; the note dropped the octave, became a low wubber, was a rush of air.\n\nThe conch was silent, a gleaming tusk; Ralph\'s face was dark with breathlessness and the air over the island was full of bird-clamor and echoes ringing.\n\n"I bet you can hear that for miles."\n\nRalph found his breath and blew a series of short blasts.\n\nPiggy exclaimed: "There\'s one!"\n\nA child had appeared among the palms, about a hundred yards along the beach. He was a boy of perhaps six years, sturdy and fair, his clothes torn, his face covered with a sticky mess of fruit. His trousers had been lowered for an obvious purpose and had only been pulled back half-way. He jumped off the palm terrace into the sand and his trousers fell about his ankles; he stepped out of them and trotted to the platform. Piggy helped him up. Meanwhile Ralph continued to blow till voices shouted in the forest. The small boy squatted in front of Ralph, looking up brightly and vertically. As he received the reassurance of something purposeful being done he began to look satisfied, and his only clean digit, a pink thumb, slid into his mouth.\n\nPiggy leaned down to him.\n\n"What\'s yer name?"\n\n"Johnny."\n\nPiggy muttered the name to himself and then shouted it to Ralph, who was not interested because he was still blowing. His face was dark with the violent pleasure of making this stupendous noise, and his heart was making the stretched shirt shake. The shouting in the forest was nearer.\n\nSigns of life were visible now on the beach. The sand, trembling beneath the heat haze, concealed many figures in its miles of length; boys were making their way toward the platform through the hot, dumb sand. Three small children, no older than Johnny, appeared from startlingly close at hand, where they had been gorging fruit in the forest. A dark little boy, not much younger than Piggy, parted a tangle of undergrowth, walked on to the platform, and smiled cheerfully at everybody. More and more of them came. Taking their cue from the innocent Johnny, they sat down on the fallen palm trunks and waited. Ralph continued to blow short, penetrating blasts. Piggy moved among the crowd, asking names and frowning to remember them. The children gave him the same simple obedience that they had given to the men with megaphones. Some were naked and carrying their clothes; others half-naked, or more or less dressed, in school uniforms, grey, blue, fawn, jacketed, or jerseyed. There were badges, mottoes even, stripes of color in stockings and pullovers. Their heads clustered above the trunks in the green shade; heads brown, fair, black, chestnut, sandy, mouse-colored; heads muttering, whispering, heads full of eyes that watched Ralph and speculated. Something was being done.\n\nThe children who came along the beach, singly or in twos, leapt into visibility when they crossed the line from heat haze to nearer sand. Here, the eye was first attracted to a black, bat-like creature that danced on the sand, and only later perceived the body above it. The bat was the child\'s shadow, shrunk by the vertical sun to a patch between the hurrying feet. Even while he blew, Ralph noticed the last pair of bodies that reached the platform above a fluttering patch of black. The two boys, bullet-headed and with hair like tow, flung themselves down and lay grinning and panting at Ralph like dogs. They were twins, and the eye was shocked and incredulous at such cheery duplication. They breathed together, they grinned together, they were chunky and vital. They raised wet lips at Ralph, for they seemed provided with not quite enough skin, so that their profiles were blurred and their mouths pulled open. Piggy bent his flashing glasses to them and could be heard between the blasts, repeating their names.\n"Sam, Eric, Sam, Eric."\n\nThen he got muddled; the twins shook their heads and pointed at each other and the crowd laughed.\n\nAt last Ralph ceased to blow and sat there, the conch trailing from one hand, his head bowed on his knees. As the echoes died away so did the laughter, and there was silence.\n\nWithin the diamond haze of the beach something dark was fumbling along. Ralph saw it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way. Then the creature stepped from mirage on to clear sand, and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but mostly clothing. The creature was a party of boys, marching approximately in step in two parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing. Shorts, shirts, and different garments they carried in their hands; but each boy wore a square black cap with a silver badge on it. Their bodies, from throat to ankle, were hidden by black cloaks which bore a long silver cross on the left breast and each neck was finished off with a hambone frill. The heat of the tropics, the descent, the search for food, and now this sweaty march along the blazing beach had given them the complexions of newly washed plums. The boy who controlled them was dressed in the same way though his cap badge was golden. When his party was about ten yards from the platform he shouted an order and they halted, gasping, sweating, swaying in the fierce light. The boy himself came forward, vaulted on to the platform with his cloak flying, and peered into what to him was almost complete darkness.\n\n"Where\'s the man with the trumpet?"\n\nRalph, sensing his sun-blindness, answered him.\n\n"There\'s no man with a trumpet. Only me."\n\nThe boy came close and peered down at Ralph, screwing up his face as he did so. What he saw of the fair-haired boy with the creamy shell on his knees did not seem to satisfy him. He turned quickly, his black cloak circling.\n\n"Isn\'t there a ship, then?"\n\nInside the floating cloak he was tall, thin, and bony; and his hair was red beneath the black cap. His face was crumpled and freckled, and ugly without silliness. Out of this face stared two light blue eyes, frustrated now, and turning, or ready to turn, to anger.\n\n"Isn\'t there a man here?"\n\nRalph spoke to his back.\n\n"No. We\'re having a meeting. Come and join in."\n\nThe group of cloaked boys began to scatter from close line. The tall boy shouted at them.\n\n"Choir! Stand still!"\n\nWearily obedient, the choir huddled into line and stood there swaying in the sun. None the less, some began to protest faintly.\n\n"But, Merridew. Please, Merridew . . . can\'t we?"\n\nThen one of the boys flopped on his face in the sand and the line broke up. They heaved the fallen boy to the platform and let him lie. Merridew, his eyes staring, made the best of a bad job.\n\n"All right then. Sit down. Let him alone."\n\n"But Merridew."\n\n"He\'s always throwing a faint," said Merridew. "He did in Gib.; and Addis; and at matins over the precentor."\n\nThis last piece of shop brought sniggers from the choir, who perched like black birds on the criss-cross trunks and examined Ralph with interest. Piggy asked no names. He was intimidated by this uniformed superiority and the offhand authority in Merridew\'s voice. He shrank to the other side of Ralph and busied himself with his glasses.\nMerridew turned to Ralph.\n\n"Aren\'t there any grownups?"\n\n"No."\n\nMerridew sat down on a trunk and looked round the circle.\n\n"Then we\'ll have to look after ourselves."\n\nSecure on the other side of Ralph, Piggy spoke timidly.\n\n"That\'s why Ralph made a meeting. So as we can decide what to do. We\'ve heard names. That\'s Johnny. Those two--they\'re twins, Sam \'n Eric. Which is Eric--? You? No--you\'re Sam--"\n\n"I\'m Sam--"\n\n"\'n I\'m Eric."\n\n"We\'d better all have names," said Ralph, "so I\'m Ralph."\n\n"We got most names," said Piggy. "Got \'em just now."\n\n"Kids\' names," said Merridew. "Why should I be Jack? I\'m Merridew."\nRalph turned to him quickly. This was the voice of one who knew his own mind.\n\n"Then," went on Piggy, "that boy--I forget--"\n\n"You\'re talking too much," said Jack Merridew. "Shut up, Fatty."\nLaughter arose.\n\n"He\'s not Fatty," cried Ralph, "his real name\'s Piggy!"\n\n"Piggy!"\n\n"Piggy!"\n\n"Oh, Piggy!"\n\nA storm of laughter arose and even the tiniest child joined in. For the moment the boys were a closed circuit of sympathy with Piggy outside: he went very pink, bowed his head and cleaned his glasses again.\n\nFinally the laughter died away and the naming continued. There was Maurice, next in size among the choir boys to Jack, but broad and grinning all the time. There was a slight, furtive boy whom no one knew, who kept to himself with an inner intensity of avoidance and secrecy. He muttered that his name was Roger and was silent again. Bill, Robert, Harold, Henry; the choir boy who had fainted sat up against a palm trunk, smiled pallidly at Ralph and said that his name was Simon.\n\nJack spoke.\n\n"We\'ve got to decide about being rescued."\n\nThere was a buzz. One of the small boys, Henry, said that he wanted to go home.\n\n"Shut up," said Ralph absently. He lifted the conch. "Seems to me we ought to have a chief to decide things."\n\n"A chief! A chief!"\n\n"I ought to be chief," said Jack with simple arrogance, "because I\'m chapter chorister and head boy. I can sing C sharp."\nAnother buzz.\n\n"Well then," said Jack, "I--"\n\nHe hesitated. The dark boy, Roger, stirred at last and spoke up.\n\n"Let\'s have a vote."\n\n"Yes!"\n\n"Vote for chief!"\n\n"Let\'s vote--"\n\nThis toy of voting was almost as pleasing as the conch. Jack started to protest but the clamor changed from the general wish for a chief to an election by acclaim of Ralph himself. None of the boys could have found good reason for this; what intelligence had been shown was traceable to Piggy while the most obvious leader was Jack. But there was a stillness about Ralph as he sat that marked him out: there was his size, and attractive appearance; and most obscurely, yet most powerfully, there was the conch. The being that had blown that, had sat waiting for them on the platform with the delicate thing balanced on his knees, was set apart.\n\n"Him with the shell."\n\n"Ralph! Ralph!"\n\n"Let him be chief with the trumpet-thing."\n\nRalph raised a hand for silence.\n\n"All right. Who wants Jack for chief?"\nWith dreary obedience the choir raised their hands.\n\n"Who wants me?"\n\nEvery hand outside the choir except Piggy\'s was raised immediately. Then Piggy, too, raised his hand grudgingly into the air.\nRalph counted.\n\n"I\'m chief then."\n\nThe circle of boys broke into applause. Even the choir applauded; and the freckles on Jack\'s face disappeared under a blush of mortification. He started up, then changed his mind and sat down again while the air rang. Ralph looked at him, eager to offer something.\n\n"The choir belongs to you, of course."\n\n"They could be the army--"\n\n"Or hunters--"\n\n"They could be--"\n\nThe suffusion drained away from Jack\'s face. Ralph waved again for silence.\n\n"Jack\'s in charge of the choir. They can be--what do you want them to be?"\n\n"Hunters."\n\nJack and Ralph smiled at each other with shy liking. The rest began to talk eagerly.\n\nJack stood up.\n\n"All right, choir. Take off your togs."\n\nAs if released from class, the choir boys stood up, chattered, piled their black cloaks on the grass. Jack laid his on the trunk by Ralph. His grey shorts were sticking to him with sweat. Ralph glanced at them admiringly, and when Jack saw his glance he explained.\n\n"I tried to get over that hill to see if there was water all round. But your shell called us."\n\nRalph smiled and held up the conch for silence.\n\n"Listen, everybody. I\'ve got to have time to think things out. I can\'t decide what to do straight off. If this isn\'t an island we might be rescued straight away. So we\'ve got to decide if this is an island. Everybody must stay round here and wait and not go away. Three of us--if we take more we\'d get all mixed, and lose each other--three of us will go on an expedition and find out. I\'ll go, and Jack, and, and . . ."\n\nHe looked round the circle of eager faces. There was no lack of boys to choose from.\n\n"And Simon."\n\nThe boys round Simon giggled, and he stood up, laughing a little. Now that the pallor of his faint was over, he was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and coarse.\n\nHe nodded at Ralph.\n\n"I\'ll come."\n\n"And I--"\n\nJack snatched from behind him a sizable sheath-knife and clouted it into a trunk. The buzz rose and died away.\n\nPiggy stirred.\n\n"I\'ll come."\n\nRalph turned to him.\n\n"You\'re no good on a job like this."\n\n"All the same--"\n\n"We don\'t want you," said Jack, flatly. "Three\'s enough."\nPiggy\'s glasses flashed.\n\n"I was with him when he found the conch. I was with him before anyone else was."\n\nJack and the others paid no attention. There was a general dispersal. Ralph, Jack and Simon jumped off the platform and walked along the sand past the bathing pool. Piggy hung bumbling behind them.\n\n"If Simon walks in the middle of us," said Ralph, "then we could talk over his head."\n\nThe three of them fell into step. This meant that every now and then Simon had to do a double shuffle to catch up with the others. Presently Ralph stopped and turned back to Piggy.\n\n"Look."\n\nJack and Simon pretended to notice nothing. They walked on.\n\n"You can\'t come."\n\nPiggy\'s glasses were misted again--this time with humiliation.\n\n"You told \'em. After what I said."\n\nHis face flushed, his mouth trembled.\n\n"After I said I didn\'t want--"\n\n"What on earth are you talking about?"\n\n"About being called Piggy. I said I didn\'t care as long as they didn\'t call me Piggy; an\' I said not to tell and then you went an\' said straight out--"\n\nStillness descended on them. Ralph, looking with more understanding at Piggy, saw that he was hurt and crushed. He hovered between the two courses of apology or further insult.\n\n"Better Piggy than Fatty," he said at last, with the directness of genuine leadership, "and anyway, I\'m sorry if you feel like that. Now go back, Piggy, and take names. That\'s your job. So long."\nHe turned and raced after the other two. Piggy stood and the rose of indignation faded slowly from his cheeks. He went back to the platform.\n\nThe three boys walked briskly on the sand. The tide was low and there was a strip of weed-strewn beach that was almost as firm as a road. A kind of glamour was spread over them and the scene and they were conscious of the glamour and made happy by it. They turned to each other, laughing excitedly, talking, not listening. The air was bright. Ralph, faced by the task of translating all this into an explanation, stood on his head and fell over. When they had done laughing, Simon stroked Ralph\'s arm shyly; and they had to laugh again.\n\n"Come on," said Jack presently, "we\'re explorers."\n\n"We\'ll go to the end of the island," said Ralph, "and look round the corner."\n\n"If it is an island--"\n\nNow, toward the end of the afternoon, the mirages were settling a little. They found the end of the island, quite distinct, and not magicked out of shape or sense. There was a jumble of the usual squareness, with one great block sitting out in the lagoon. Sea birds were nesting there.\n\n"Like icing," said Ralph, "on a pink cake."\n\n"We shan\'t see round this corner," said Jack, "because there isn\'t one. Only a slow curve--and you can see, the rocks get worse--"\n\nRalph shaded his eyes and followed the jagged outline of the crags up toward the mountain. This part of the beach was nearer the mountain than any other that they had seen.\n\n"We\'ll try climbing the mountain from here," he said. "I should think this is the easiest way. There\'s less of that jungly stuff; and more pink rock. Come on."\n\nThe three boys began to scramble up. Some unknown force had wrenched and shattered these cubes so that they lay askew, often piled diminishingly on each other. The most usual feature of the rock was a pink cliff surmounted by a skewed block; and that again surmounted, and that again, till the pinkness became a stack of balanced rock projecting through the looped fantasy of the forest creepers. Where the pink cliffs rose out of the ground there were often narrow tracks winding upwards. They could edge along them, deep in the plant world, their faces to the rock.\n\n"What made this track?"\n\nJack paused, wiping the sweat from his face. Ralph stood by him, breathless.\n\n"Men?"\n\nJack shook his head.\n\n"Animals."\n\nRalph peered into the darkness under the trees. The forest minutely vibrated.\n\n"Come on."\n\nThe difficulty was not the steep ascent round the shoulders of rock, but the occasional plunges through the undergrowth to get to the next path. Here the roots and stems of creepers were in such tangles that the boys had to thread through them like pliant needles. Their only guide, apart from the brown ground and occasional flashes of light through the foliage, was the tendency of slope: whether this hole, laced as it was with the cables of creeper, stood higher than that.\n\nSomehow, they moved up.\n\nImmured in these tangles, at perhaps their most difficult moment, Ralph turned with shining eyes to the others.\n\n"Wacco."\n\n"Wizard."\n\n"Smashing."\n\nThe cause of their pleasure was not obvious. All three were hot, dirty and exhausted. Ralph was badly scratched. The creepers were as thick as their thighs and left little but tunnels for further penetration. Ralph shouted experimentally and they listened to the muted echoes.\n\n"This is real exploring," said Jack. "I bet nobody\'s been here before."\n\n"We ought to draw a map," said Ralph, "only we haven\'t any paper."\n\n"We could make scratches on bark," said Simon, "and rub black stuff in."\n\nAgain came the solemn communion of shining eyes in the gloom.\n\n"Wacco."\n\n"Wizard."\n\nThere was no place for standing on one\'s head. This time Ralph expressed the intensity of his emotion by pretending to knock Simon down; and soon they were a happy, heaving pile in the under-dusk.\n\nWhen they had fallen apart Ralph spoke first.\n\n"Got to get on."\n\nThe pink granite of the next cliff was further back from the creepers and trees so that they could trot up the path. This again led into more open forest so that they had a glimpse of the spread sea. With openness came the sun; it dried the sweat that had soaked their clothes in the dark, damp heat. At last the way to the top looked like a scramble over pink rock, with no more plunging through darkness. The boys chose their way through defiles and over heaps of sharp stone.\n\n"Look! Look!"\n\nHigh over this end of the island, the shattered rocks lifted up their stacks and chimneys. This one, against which Jack leaned, moved with a grating sound when they pushed.\n\n"Come on--"\n\nBut not "Come on" to the top. The assault on the summit must wait while the three boys accepted this challenge. The rock was as large as a small motor car.\n\n"Heave!"\n\nSway back and forth, catch the rhythm.\n\n"Heave!"\n\nIncrease the swing of the pendulum, increase, increase, come up and bear against that point of furthest balance-- increase--increase--\n\n"Heave!"\n\nThe great rock loitered, poised on one toe, decided not to return, moved through the air, fell, struck, turned over, leapt droning through the air and smashed a deep hole in the canopy of the forest. Echoes and birds flew, white and pink dust floated, the forest further down shook as with the passage of an enraged monster: and then the island was still.\n\n"Wacco!"\n\n"Like a bomb!"\n\n"Whee-aa-oo!"\n\nNot for five minutes could they drag themselves away from this triumph. But they left at last.\n\nThe way to the top was easy after that. As they reached the last stretch Ralph stopped.\n\n"Golly!"\n\nThey were on the lip of a circular hollow in the side of the mountain.\n\nThis was filled with a blue flower, a rock plant of some sort, and the overflow hung down the vent and spilled lavishly among the canopy of the forest. The air was thick with butterflies, lifting, fluttering, settling.\n\nBeyond the hollow was the square top of the mountain and soon they were standing on it.\n\nThey had guessed before that this was an island: clambering among the pink rocks, with the sea on either side, and the crystal heights of air, they had known by some instinct that the sea lay on every side. But there seemed something more fitting in leaving the last word till they stood on the top, and could see a circular horizon of water.\n\nRalph turned to the others.\n\n"This belongs to us."\n\nIt was roughly boat-shaped: humped near this end with behind them the jumbled descent to the shore. On either side rocks, cliffs, treetops and a steep slope: forward there, the length of the boat, a tamer descent, tree-clad, with hints of pink: and then the jungly flat of the island, dense green, but drawn at the end to a pink tail. There, where the island petered out in water, was another island; a rock, almost detached, standing like a fort, facing them across the green with one bold, pink bastion.\n\nThe boys surveyed all this, then looked out to sea. They were high up and the afternoon had advanced; the view was not robbed of sharpness by mirage.\n\n"That\'s a reef. A coral reef. I\'ve seen pictures like that."\n\nThe reef enclosed more than one side of the island, lying perhaps a mile out and parallel to what they now thought of as their beach. The coral was scribbled in the sea as though a giant had bent down to reproduce the shape of the island in a flowing chalk line but tired before he had finished. Inside was peacock water, rocks and weeds showing as in an aquarium; outside was the dark blue of the sea. The tide was running so that long streaks of foam tailed away from the reef and for a moment they felt that the boat was moving steadily astern.\n\nJack pointed down.\n\n"That\'s where we landed."\n\nBeyond falls and cliffs there was a gash visible in the trees; there were the splintered trunks and then the drag, leaving only a fringe of palm between the scar and the sea. There, too, jutting into the lagoon, was the platform, with insect-like figures moving near it.\nRalph sketched a twining line from the bald spot on which they stood down a slope, a gully, through flowers, round and down to the rock where the scar started.\n\n"That\'s the quickest way back."\n\nEyes shining, mouths open, triumphant, they savored the right of domination. They were lifted up: were friends.\n\n"There\'s no village smoke, and no boats," said Ralph wisely. "We\'ll make sure later; but I think it\'s uninhabited."\n\n"We\'ll get food," cried Jack. "Hunt. Catch things. until they fetch us."\n\nSimon looked at them both, saying nothing but nodding till his black hair flopped backwards and forwards: his face was glowing.\n\nRalph looked down the other way where there was no reef.\n\n"Steeper," said Jack.\n\nRalph made a cupping gesture.\n\n"That bit of forest down there . . . the mountain holds it up."\n\nEvery point of the mountain held up trees--flowers and trees. Now the forest stirred, roared, flailed. The nearer acres of rock flowers fluttered and for half a minute the breeze blew cool on their faces.\nRalph spread his arms.\n\n"All ours."\n\nThey laughed and tumbled and shouted on the mountain.\n\n"I\'m hungry."\n\nWhen Simon mentioned his hunger the others became aware of theirs.\n\n"Come on," said Ralph. "We\'ve found out what we wanted to know."\n\nThey scrambled down a rock slope, dropped among flowers and made their way under the trees. Here they paused and examined the bushes round them curiously.\n\nSimon spoke first.\n\n"Like candles. Candle bushes. Candle buds."\n\nThe bushes were dark evergreen and aromatic and the many buds were waxen green and folded up against the light. Jack slashed at one with his knife and the scent spilled over them.\n\n"Candle buds."\n\n"You couldn\'t light them," said Ralph. "They just look like candles."\n\n"Green candles," said Jack contemptuously. "We can\'t eat them. Come on."\n\nThey were in the beginnings of the thick forest, plonking with weary feet on a track, when they heard the noises--squeakings--and the hard strike of hoofs on a path. As they pushed forward the squeaking increased till it became a frenzy. They found a piglet caught in a curtain of creepers, throwing itself at the elastic traces in all the madness of extreme terror. Its voice was thin, needle-sharp and insistent; The three boys rushed forward and Jack drew his knife again with a flourish. He raised his arm in the air. There came a pause, a hiatus, the pig continued to scream and the creepers to jerk, and the blade continued to flash at the end of a bony arm. The pause was only long enough for them to understand what an enormity the downward stroke would be. Then the piglet tore loose from the creepers and scurried into the undergrowth. They were left looking at each other and the place of terror. Jack\'s face was white under the freckles. He noticed that he still held the knife aloft and brought his arm down replacing the blade in the sheath. Then they all three laughed ashamedly and began to climb back to the track.\n\n"I was choosing a place," said Jack. "I was just waiting for a moment to decide where to stab him."\n\n"You should stick a pig," said Ralph fiercely. "They always talk about sticking a pig."\n\n"You cut a pig\'s throat to let the blood out," said Jack, "otherwise you can\'t eat the meat."\n\n"Why didn\'t you--?"\n\nThey knew very well why he hadn\'t: because of the enormity of the knife descending and cutting into living flesh; because of the unbearable blood.\n\n"I was going to," said Jack. He was ahead of them, and they could not see his face. "I was choosing a place. Next time--!"\nHe snatched his knife out of the sheath and slammed it into a tree trunk. Next time there would be no mercy. He looked round fiercely, daring them to contradict. Then they broke out into the sunlight and for a while they were busy finding and devouring food as they moved down the scar toward the platform and the meeting.',se='By the time Ralph finished blowing the conch the platform was crowded. There were differences between this meeting and the one held in the morning. The afternoon sun slanted in from the other side of the platform and most of the children, feeling too late the smart of sunburn, had put their clothes on. The choir, noticeably less of a group, had discarded their cloaks.\n\nRalph sat on a fallen trunk, his left side to the sun. On his right were most of the choir; on his left the larger boys who had not known each other before the evacuation; before him small children squatted in the grass.\n\nSilence now. Ralph lifted the cream and pink shell to his knees and a sudden breeze scattered light over the platform. He was uncertain whether to stand up or remain sitting. He looked sideways to his left, toward the bathing pool. Piggy was sitting near but giving no help.\n\nRalph cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cWell then.\u201d\n\nAll at once he found he could talk fluently and explain what he had to say. He passed a hand through his fair hair and spoke.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on an island. We\u2019ve been on the mountain top and seen water all round. We saw no houses, no smoke, no footprints, no boats, no people. We\u2019re on an uninhabited island with no other people on it.\u201d\n\nJack broke in.\n\n\u201cAll the same you need an army-for hunting. Hunting pigs-\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. There are pigs on the island.\u201d\n\nAll three of them tried to convey the sense of the pink live thing struggling in the creepers.\n\n\u201cWe saw-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSquealing-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt broke away-\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore I could kill it-but-next time!\u201d\n\nJack slammed his knife into a trunk and looked round challengingly.\n\nThe meeting settled down again.\n\n\u201cSo you see,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cwe need hunters to get us meat. And another thing.\u201d\n\nHe lifted the shell on his knees and looked round the sun-slashed faces.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any grownups. We shall have to look after ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe meeting hummed and was silent.\n\n\u201cAnd another thing. We can\u2019t have everybody talking at once. Well have to have \u2018Hands up\u2019 like at school.\u201d\n\nHe held the conch before his face and glanced round the mouth.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll give him the conch.\u201d\n\n\u201cConch?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this shell\u2019s called. I\'ll give the conch to the next person to speak. He can hold it when he\u2019s speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\n\u201cLook-\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he won\u2019t be interrupted. Except by me.\u201d\n\nJack was on his feet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have rules!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cLots of rules! Then when anyone breaks \u2018em-\u201d\n\n\u201cWhee-oh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWacco!\u201d\n\n\u201cBong!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoink!\u201d\n\nRalph felt the conch lifted from his lap. Then Piggy was standing cradling the great cream shell and the shouting died down. Jack, left on his feet, looked uncertainly at Ralph who smiled and patted the log. Jack sat down. Piggy took off his glasses and blinked at the assembly while he wiped them on his shirt.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hindering Ralph. You\u2019re not letting him get to the most important thing.\u201d\n\nHe paused effectively.\n\u201cWho knows we\u2019re here? Eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey knew at the airport\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man with a trumpet-thing-\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dad.\u201d\n\nPiggy put on his glasses.\n\u201cNobody knows where we are,\u201d said Piggy. He was paler than before and breathless. \u201cPerhaps they knew where we was going to; and perhaps not. But they don\u2019t know where we are \u2018cos we never got there.\u201d He gaped at them for a moment, then swayed and sat down. Ralph took the conch from his hands.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to say,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhen you all, all. . . .\u201d He gazed at their intent faces. \u201cThe plane was shot down in flames. Nobody knows where we are. We may be here a long time.\u201d\n\nThe silence was so complete that they could hear the unevenness of Piggy\u2019s breathing. The sun slanted in and lay golden over half the platform. The breezes that on the lagoon had chased their tails like kittens were finding then-way across the platform and into the forest. Ralph pushed back the tangle of fair hair that hung on his forehead.\n\n\u201cSo we may be here a long time.\u201d\n\nNobody said anything. He grinned suddenly.\n\n\u201cBut this is a good island. We-Jack, Simon and me- we climbed the mountain. It\u2019s wizard. There\u2019s food and drink, and-\u201d\n\n\u201cRocks-\u201d\n\n\u201cBlue flowers-\u201d\n\nPiggy, partly recovered, pointed to the conch in Ralph\u2019s hands, and Jack and Simon fell silent. Ralph went on.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting we can have a good time on this island.\u201d\n\nHe gesticulated widely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like in a book.\u201d\n\nAt once there was a clamor.\n\n\u201cTreasure Island-\u201d\n\n\u201cSwallows and Amazons-\u201d\n\n\u201cCoral Island-\u201d\n\nRalph waved the conch.\n\n\u201cThis is our island. It\u2019s a good island. Until the grownups come to fetch us we\u2019ll have fun.\u201d\n\nJack held out his hand for the conch.\n\n"There\u2019s pigs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s food; and bathing water in that little stream along there-and everything. Didn\u2019t anyone find anything else?\u201d\n\nHe handed the conch back to Ralph and sat down. Apparently no one had found anything.\n\nThe older boys first noticed the child when he resisted. There was a group of little boys urging him forward and he did not want to go. He was a shrimp of a boy, about six years old, and one side of his face was blotted out by a mulberry-colored birthmark. He stood now, warped out of the perpendicular by the fierce light of publicity, and he bored into the coarse grass with one toe. He was muttering and about to cry.\n\nThe other little boys, whispering but serious, pushed him toward Ralph.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Ralph, \u201ccome on then.\u201d\n\nThe small boy looked round in panic.\n\n\u201cSpeak up!\u201d\n\nThe small boy held out his hands for the conch and the assembly shouted with laughter; at once \u2018he snatched back his hands and started to cry.\n\n\u201cLet him have the conch!\u201d shouted Piggy. \u201cLet him have it!\u201d\n\nAt last Ralph induced him to hold the shell but by then the blow of laughter had taken away the child\u2019s voice. Piggy knelt by him, one hand on the great shell, listening and interpreting to the assembly.\n\n\u201cHe wants to know what you\u2019re going to do about the snake-thing.\u201d\n\nRalph laughed, and the other boys laughed with him. The small boy twisted further into himself.\n\n\u201cTell us about the snake-thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow he says it was a beastie.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeastie?\u201d\n\n\u201cA snake-thing. Ever so big. He saw it\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the woods.\u201d\n\nEither the wandering breezes or perhaps the decline of the sun allowed a little coolness to lie under the trees. The boys felt it and stirred restlessly.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have a beastie, a snake-thing, on an island this size,\u201d Ralph explained kindly. \u201cYou only get them in big countries, like Africa, or India.\u201d\n\n\nMurmur; and the grave nodding of heads.\n\n\u201cHe says the beastie came in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he couldn\u2019t see it!\u201d\n\nLaughter and cheers.\n\n\u201cDid you hear that? Says he saw the thing in the dark-\u201d\n\n\u201cHe still says he saw the beastie. It came and went away again an\u2019 came back and wanted to eat him-\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was dreaming.\u201d\n\nLaughing, Ralph looked for confirmation round the ring of faces. The older boys agreed; but here and there among the little ones was the doubt that required more than rational assurance.\n\n\u201cHe must have had a nightmare. Stumbling about among all those creepers.\u201d\n\nMore grave nodding; they knew about nightmares. \u201cHe says he saw the beastie, the snake-thing, and will it come back tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there isn\u2019t a beastie!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says in the morning it turned into them things like ropes in the trees and hung in the branches. He says will it come back tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there isn\u2019t a beastie!\u201d\n\nThere was no laughter at all now and more grave watching. Ralph pushed both hands through his hair and looked at the little boy in mixed amusement and exasperation.\n\nJack seized the conch.\n\n\u201cRalph\u2019s right of course. There isn\u2019t a snake-thing. But if there was a snake we\u2019d hunt it and kill it. We\u2019re going to hunt pigs to get meat for everybody. And we\u2019ll look for the snake too-\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there isn\u2019t a snake!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure when we go hunting.\u201d\n\nRalph was annoyed and, for the moment, defeated. He felt himself facing something ungraspable. The eyes that looked so intently at him were without humor.\n\n\u201cBut there isn\u2019t a beast!\u201d\n\nSomething he had not known was there rose in him and compelled him to make the point, loudly and again.\n\n\u201cBut I tell you there isn\u2019t a beast!\u201d\n\nThe assembly was silent.\n\nRalph lifted the conch again and his good humor came back as he thought of what he had to say next.\n\n\u201cNow we come to the most important thing. I\u2019ve been thinking. I was thinking while we were climbing the mountain.\u201d He flashed a conspiratorial grin at the other two. \u201cAnd on the beach just now. This is what I thought. We want to have fun. And we want to be rescued.\u201d\n\nThe passionate noise of agreement from the assembly hit him like a wave and he lost his thread. He thought again.\n\n\n\u201cWe want to be rescued; and of course we shall be rescued.\u201d\n\nVoices babbled. The simple statement, unbacked by any proof but the weight of Ralph\u2019s new authority, brought light and happiness. He had to wave the conch before he could make them hear him.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s in the Navy. He said there aren\u2019t any unknown islands left. He says the Queen has a big room full of maps and all the islands in the world are drawn there. So the Queen\u2019s got a picture of this island.\u201d\n\nAgain came the sounds of cheerfulness and better heart.\n\n\u201cAnd sooner or later a ship will put in here. It might even be Daddy\u2019s ship. So you see, sooner or later, we shall be rescued.\u201d\n\nHe paused, with the point made. The assembly was lifted toward safety by his words. They liked and now respected him. Spontaneously they began to clap and presently the platform was loud with applause. Ralph flushed, looking sideways at Piggy\u2019s open admiration, and then the other way at Jack who was smirking and showing that he too knew how to clap.\n\nRalph waved the conch.\n\n\u201cShut up! Wait! Listen!\u201d\n\nHe went on in the silence, borne on his triumph.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another thing. We can help them to find us. If a ship comes near the island they may not notice us. So we must make smoke on top of the mountain. We must make a fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cA fire! Make a fire!\u201d\n\nAt once half the boys were on their feet. Jack clamored among them, the conch forgotten. \u201cCome on! Follow me!\u201d\n\nThe space under the palm trees was full of noise and movement. Ralph was on his feet too, shouting for quiet, but no one heard him. All at once the crowd swayed toward the island and was gone-following Jack. Even the tiny children went and did their best among the leaves and broken branches. Ralph was left, holding the conch, with no one but Piggy.\n\nPiggy\u2019s breathing was quite restored.\n\n\u201cLike kids!\u201d he said scornfully. \u201cActing like a crowd of lads!\u201d\n\nRalph looked at him doubtfully and laid the conch on the tree trunk.\n\n\u201cI bet it\u2019s gone tea-time,\u201d said Piggy. \u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re going to do on that mountain?\u201d\n\nHe caressed the shell respectfully, then stopped and looked up.\n\n\u201cRalph! Hey! Where you going?\u201d\n\nRalph was already clambering over the first smashed swathes of the scar. A long way ahead of him was crashing and laughter.\n\nPiggy watched him in disgust.\n\n\u201cLike a crowd of lads-\u201d\n\nHe sighed, bent, and laced up his shoes. The noise of the errant assembly faded up the mountain. Then, with the martyred expression of a parent who has to keep up with the senseless ebullience of the children, he picked up the conch, turned toward the forest, and began to pick his way over the tumbled scar.\n\nBelow the other side of the mountain top was a platform of forest. Once more Ralph found himself making the cupping gesture.\n\n\u201cDown there we could get as much wood as we want.\u201d\n\nJack nodded and pulled at his underlip. Starting perhaps a hundred feet below them on the steeper side of the mountain, the patch might have been designed expressly for fuel. Trees, forced by the damp heat, found too little soil for full growth, fell early and decayed: creepers cradled them, and new saplings searched a way up.\n\nJack turned to the choir, who stood ready. Their black caps of maintenance were slid over one ear like berets.\n\n\u201cWell build a pile. Come on.\u201d\n\nThey found the likeliest path down and began tugging at the dead wood. And the small boys who had reached the top came sliding too till everyone but Piggy was busy. Most of the wood was so rotten that when they pulled it broke up into a shower of fragments and woodlice and decay; but some trunks came out in one piece. The twins, Sam \u2018n Eric, were the first to get a likely log but they could do nothing till Ralph, Jack, Simon, Roger and Maurice found room for a hand-hold. Then they inched the grotesque dead thing up the rock and toppled it over on top. Each party of boys added a quota, less or more, and the pile grew. At the return Ralph found himself alone on a limb with Jack and they grinned at each other, sharing this burden. Once more, amid the breeze, the shouting, the slanting sunlight on the high mountain, was shed that glamour, that strange invisible light of friendship, adventure, and content.\n\n\u201cAlmost too heavy.\u201d\n\nJack grinned back.\n\n\u201cNot for the two of us.\u201d\n\nTogether, joined in effort by the burden, they staggered up the last steep of the mountain. Together, they chanted One! Two! Three! and crashed the log on to the great pile. Then they stepped back, laughing with triumphant pleasure, so that immediately Ralph had to stand on his head. Below them, boys were still laboring, though some of the small ones had lost interest and were searching this new forest for fruit. Now the twins, with unsuspected intelligence, came up the mountain with armfuls of dried leaves and dumped them against the pile. One by one, as they sensed that the pile was complete, the boys stopped going back for more and stood, with the pink, shattered top of the mountain around them. Breath came evenly by now, and sweat dried.\n\nRalph and Jack looked at each other while society paused about them. The shameful knowledge grew in them and they did not know how to begin confession.\n\nRalph spoke first, crimson in the face.\n\n\u201cWill you?\u201d\n\nHe cleared his throat and went on.\n\n\u201cWill you light the fire?\u201d\n\nNow the absurd situation was open, Jack blushed too. He began to mutter vaguely.\n\n\u201cYou rub two sticks. You rub-\u201d\n\nHe glanced at Ralph, who blurted out the last confession of incompetence. \u201cHas anyone got any matches?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make a bow and spin the arrow,\u201d said Roger. He rubbed his hands in mime. \u201cPsss. Psss.\u201d\n\nA little air was moving over the mountain. Piggy came with it, in shorts and shirt, laboring cautiously out of the forest with the evening sunlight gleaming from his glasses. He held the conch under his arm.\n\nRalph shouted at him.\n\n\u201cPiggy! Have you got any matches?\u201d\n\nThe other boys took up the cry till the mountain rang. Piggy shook his head and came to the pile.\n\n\u201cMy! You\u2019ve made a big heap, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nJack pointed suddenly.\n\n\u201cHis specs-use them as burning glasses!\u201d\n\nPiggy was surrounded before he could back away.\n\n\u201cHere- let me go!\u201d His voice rose to a shriek of terror as Jack snatched the glasses off his face. \u201cMind out! Give \u2019em back! I can hardly see! You\u2019ll break the conch!\u201d\n\nRalph elbowed him to one side and knelt by the pile.\n\n\u201cStand out of the light.\u201d\n\nThere was pushing and pulling and officious cries. Ralph moved the lenses back and forth, this way and that, till a glossy white image of the declining sun lay on a piece of rotten wood. Almost at once a thin trickle of smoke rose up and made him cough. Jack knelt too and blew gently, so that the smoke drifted away, thickening, and a tiny name appeared. The flame, nearly invisible at first in that bright sunlight, enveloped a small twig, grew, was enriched with color and reached up to a branch which exploded with a sharp crack. The flame flapped higher and the boys broke into a cheer.\n\n\u201cMy specs!\u201d howled Piggy. \u201cGive me my specs!\u201d\n\nRalph stood away from the pile and put the glasses into Piggy s groping hands. His voice subsided to a mutter.\n\n\u201cJus\' blurs, that\u2019s all. Hardly see my hand-\u201d\n\nThe boys were dancing. The pile was so rotten, and now so tinder-dry, that whole limbs yielded passionately to the yellow flames that poured upwards and shook a great beard of flame twenty feet in the air. For yards round the fire the heat was like a blow, and the breeze was a river of sparks. Trunks crumbled to white dust.\n\nRalph shouted.\n\n\u201cMore wood! All of you get more wood!\u201d\n\nLife became a race with the fire and the boys scattered through the upper forest. To keep a clean flag of flame flying on the mountain was the immediate end and no one looked further. Even the smallest boys, unless fruit claimed them, brought little pieces of wood and threw them in. The air moved a little faster and became a light wind, so that leeward and windward side were clearly differentiated. On one side the air was cool, but on the other the fire thrust out a savage arm of heat that crinkled hair on the instant. Boys who felt the evening wind on their damp faces paused to enjoy the freshness of it and then found they were exhausted. They flung themselves down in the shadows that lay among the shattered rocks. The beard of flame diminished quickly; then the pile fell inwards with a soft, cindery sound, and sent a great tree of sparks upwards that leaned away and drifted downwind. The boys lay, panting like dogs.\n\nRalph raised his head off his forearms.\n\n\u201cThat was no good.\u201d\n\nRoger spat efficiently into the hot dust.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any smoke. Only flame.\u201d\n\nPiggy had settled himself in a space between two rocks, and sat with the conch on his knees.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made a fire,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s any use. We couldn\u2019t keep a fire like that going, not if we tried.\u2019\n\n\u201cA fat lot you tried,\u201d said Jack contemptuously. \u201cYou just sat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe used his specs,\u201d said Simon, smearing a black cheek with his forearm. He helped that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the conch,\u201d said Piggy indignantly. \u201cYou let me speak!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conch doesn\u2019t count on top of the mountain,\u201d said Jack, \u201cso you shut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the conch in my hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut on green branches,\u201d said Maurice. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to make smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the conch-\u201d\n\nJack turned fiercely. \u201cYou shut up!\u201d\n\nPiggy wilted. Ralph took the conch from him and looked round the circle of boys.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have special people for looking after the fire. Any day there may be a ship out there\u201d-he waved his arm at the taut wire of the horizon-\u201dand if we have a signal going they\u2019ll come and take us off. And another thing. We ought to have more rules. Where the conch is, that\u2019s a meeting. The same up here as down there.\u201d\n\nThey assented. Piggy opened his mouth to speak, caught Jack\u2019s eye and shut it again. Jack held out his hands for the conch and stood up, holding the delicate thing carefully in his sooty hands.\n\n\u201cI agree with Ralph. We\u2019ve got to have rules and obey them. After all, we\u2019re not savages. We\u2019re English, and the English are best at everything. So we\u2019ve got to do the right things.\u201d\n\nHe turned to Ralph.\n\n\u201cRalph, I\u2019ll split up the choir-my hunters, that is-into groups, and we\u2019ll be responsible for keeping the fire going-\u201d\n\nThis generosity brought a spatter of applause from the boys, so that Jack grinned at them, then waved the conch for silence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let the fire burn out now. Who would see smoke at night-time, anyway? And we can start the fire again whenever we like. Altos, you can keep the fire going this week, and trebles the next-\u201d\n\nThe assembly assented gravely.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll be responsible for keeping a lookout too. If we see a ship out there\u201d-they followed the direction of his bony arm with their eyes-\u201dwe\u2019ll put green branches on. Then there\u2019ll be more smoke.\u201d\n\nThey gazed intently at the dense blue of the horizon, as if a little silhouette might appear there at any moment.\n\nThe sun in the west was a drop of burning gold that slid nearer and nearer the sill of the world. All at once they were aware of the evening as the end of light and warmth.\n\nRoger took the conch and looked round at them gloomily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching the sea. There hasn\u2019t been the trace of a ship. Perhaps we\u2019ll never be rescued.\u201d\n\nA murmur rose and swept away. Ralph took back the conch.\n\n\u201cI said before we\u2019ll be rescued sometime. We\u2019ve just got to wait, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nDaring, indignant, Piggy took the conch.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said! I said about our meetings and things and then you said shut up-\u201d\n\nHis voice lifted into the whine of virtuous recrimination. They stirred and began to shout him down.\n\n\u201cYou said you wanted a small fire and you been and built a pile like a hayrick. If I say anything,\u2019 cried Piggy, with bitter realism, \u201cyou say shut up; but if Jack or Maurice or Simon-\u201d\n\nHe paused in the tumult, standing, looking beyond them and down the unfriendly side of the mountain to the great patch where they had found dead wood. Then he laughed so strangely that they were hushed, looking at the flash of his spectacles in astonishment. They followed his gaze to find the sour joke.\n\n\u201cYou got your small fire all right.\u201d\n\nSmoke was rising here and there among the creepers that festooned the dead or dying trees. As they watched, a flash of fire appeared at the root of one wisp, and then the smoke thickened. Small flames stirred at the trunk of a tree and crawled away through leaves and brushwood, dividing and increasing. One patch touched a tree trunk and scrambled up like a bright squirrel. The smoke increased, sifted, rolled outwards. The squirrel leapt on the wings of the wind and clung to another standing tree, eating downwards. Beneath the dark canopy of leaves and smoke the fire laid hold on the forest and began to gnaw. Acres of black and yellow smoke rolled steadily toward the sea. At the sight of the flames and the irresistible course of the fire, the boys broke into shrill, excited cheering. The flames, as though they were a kind of wild life, crept as a jaguar creeps on its belly toward a line of birch-like saplings that fledged an outcrop of the pink rock. They flapped at the first of the trees, and the branches grew a brief foliage of fire. The heart of flame leapt nimbly across the gap between the trees and then went swinging and flaring along the whole row of them. Beneath the capering boys a quarter of a mile square of forest was savage with smoke and flame. The separate noises of the fire merged into a drum-roll that seemed to shake the mountain.\n\n\u201cYou got your small fire all right\u201d\n\nStartled, Ralph realized that the boys were falling still and silent, feeling the beginnings of awe at the power set free below them. The knowledge and the awe made him savage.\n\n\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the conch,\u201d said Piggy, in a hurt voice. \u201cI got a right to speak.\u201d\n\nThey looked at him with eyes that lacked interest in what they saw, and cocked ears at the drum-roll of the fire. Piggy glanced nervously into hell and cradled the conch.\n\n\u201cWe got to let that burn out now. And that was our firewood.\u201d\n\nHe licked his lips.\n\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t nothing we can do. We ought to be more careful. I\u2019m scared-\u201d\n\nJack dragged his eyes away from the fire. \u201cYou\u2019re always scared. Yah-Fatty!\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the conch,\u201d said Piggy bleakly. He turned to Ralph. \u201cI got the conch, ain\u2019t I Ralph?\u201d\n\nUnwillingly Ralph turned away from the splendid, awful sight\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conch. I got a right to speak.\u201d\n\nThe twins giggled together.\n\n\u201cWe wanted smoke-\u201d\n\n\u201cNow look-!\u201d\n\nA pall stretched for miles away from the island. All the boys except Piggy started to giggle; presently they were shrieking with laughter.\n\nPiggy lost his temper.\n\n\u201cI got the conch! Just you listen! The first thing we ought to have made was shelters down there by the beach. It wasn\u2019t half cold down there in the night. But the first time Ralph says \u2018fire\u2019 you goes howling and screaming up this here mountain. Like a pack of kids!\u201d\n\nBy now they were listening to the tirade.\n\n\u201cHow can you expect to be rescued if you don\u2019t put first things first and act proper?\u201d\n\nHe took off his glasses and made as if to put down the conch; but the sudden motion toward it of most of the older boys changed his mind. He tucked the shell under his arm, and crouched back on a rock.\n\n\u201cThen when you get here you build a bonfire that isn\u2019t no use. Now you been and set the whole island on fire. Won\u2019t we look funny if the whole island burns up? Cooked fruit, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have to eat, and roast pork. And that\u2019s nothing to laugh at! You said Ralph was chief and you don\u2019t give him time to think. Then when he says something you rush off, like, like-\u201d\n\nHe paused for breath, and the fire growled at them.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not all. Them kids. The little \u2018uns. Who took any notice of \u2018em? Who knows how many we got?\u201d\n\nRalph took a sudden step forward.\n\n\u201cI told you to. I told you to get a list of names!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I,\u201d cried Piggy indignantly, \u201call by myself? They waited for two minutes, then they fell in the sea; they went into the forest; they just scattered everywhere. How was I to know which was which?\u201d\n\nRalph licked pale lips.\n\nThen you don\u2019t know how many of us there ought to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I with them little \u2018uns running round like insects? Then when you three came back, as soon as you said make a fire, they all ran away, and I never had a chance-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d said Ralph sharply, and snatched back the conch. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201c-then you come up here an\u2019 pinch my specs-\u201d\n\nJack turned on him.\n\n\u201cYou shut up!\u201d\n\n\u201c-and them little \u2018uns was wandering about down there where the fire is. How d\u2019you know they aren\u2019t still there?\u201d\n\nPiggy stood up and pointed to the smoke and flames. A murmur rose among the boys and died away. Something strange was happening to Piggy, for he was gasping for breath.\n\n"That little \u2018un-\u201d gasped Piggy- "him with the mark on his face, I don\u2019t see him. Where is he now?\u201d\n\nThe crowd was as silent as death.\n\n\u201cHim that talked about the snakes. He was down there-\u201d\n\nA tree exploded in the fire like a bomb. Tall swathes of creepers rose for a moment into view, agonized, and went down again. The little boys screamed at them.\n\n\u201cSnakes! Snakes! Look at the snakes!\u201d\n\nIn the west, and unheeded, the sun lay only an inch or two above the sea. Their faces were lit redly from beneath. Piggy fell against a rock and clutched it with both hands.\n\n\u201cThat little \u2018un that had a mark on his face-where is -he now? I tell you I don\u2019t see him.\u201d\n\nThe boys looked at each other fearfully, unbelieving.\n\n\u201c-where is he now?\u201d\n\nRalph muttered the reply as if in shame.\n\n\u201cPerhaps he went back to the, the-\u201d\n\nBeneath them, on the unfriendly side of the mountain, the drum-roll continued.',re="Jack was bent double. He was down like a sprinter. his nose only a few inches from the humid earth. The tree trunks and the creepers that festooned them lost themselves in a green dusk thirty feet above him, and all about was the undergrowth. There was only the faintest indication of a trail here; a cracked twig and what might be the impression of one side of a hoof. He lowered his chin and stared at the traces as though he would force them to speak to him. Then dog-like, uncomfortably on all fours yet unheeding his discomfort, he stole forward five yards and stopped. Here was loop of creeper with a tendril pendant from a node. The tendril was polished on the underside; pigs, passing through the loop, brushed it with their bristly hide.\n\nJack crouched with his face a few inches away from this clue, then stared forward into the semi-darkness of the undergrowth. His sandy hair, considerably longer than it had been when they dropped in, was lighter now; and his bare back was a mass of dark freckles and peeling sunburn. A sharpened stick about five feet long trailed from his right hand, and except for a pair of tattered shorts held up by his knife-belt he was naked. He closed his eyes, raised his head and breathed in gently with flared nostrils, assessing the current of warm air for information. The forest and he were very still.\n\nAt length he let out his breath in a long sigh and opened his eyes. They were bright blue, eyes that in this frustration seemed bolting and nearly mad. He passed his tongue across dry lips and scanned the uncommunicative forest Then again he stole forward and cast this way and that over the ground.\n\nThe silence of the forest was more oppressive than the heat, and at this hour of the day there was not even the whine of insects. Only when Jack himself roused a gaudy bird from a primitive nest of sticks was the silence shattered and echoes set ringing by a harsh cry that seemed to come out of the abyss of ages. Jack himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn breath, and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing, ape-like among the tangle of trees. Then the trail, the frustration, claimed him again and he searched the ground avidly. By the trunk of a vast tree that grew pale flowers on its grey bark he checked, closed his eyes, and once more drew in the warm air; and this time his breath came short, there was even a passing pallor in his face, and then the surge of blood again. He passed like a shadow under the darkness of the tree and crouched, looking down at the trodden ground at his feet.\n\nThe droppings were warm. They lay piled among turned earth. They were olive green, smooth, and they steamed a little. Jack lifted his head and stared at the inscrutable masses of creeper that lay across the trail. Then he raised his spear and sneaked forward. Beyond the creeper, the trail joined a pig-run that was wide enough and trodden enough to be a path. The ground was hardened by an accustomed tread and as Jack rose to his full height he heard something moving on it. He swung back his right arm and hurled the spear with all his strength. From the pig-run came the quick, hard patter of hoofs, a castanet sound, seductive, maddening-the promise of meat. He rushed out of the undergrowth and snatched up his spear. The pattering of pig\u201fs trotters died away in the distance.\n\nJack stood there, streaming with sweat, streaked with brown earth, stained by all the vicissitudes of a day's hunting. Swearing, he turned off the trail and pushed his way through until the forest opened a little and instead of bald trunks supporting a dark roof there were light grey trunks and crowns of feathery palm. Beyond these was the glitter of the sea and he could hear voices. Ralph was standing by a contraption of palm trunks and leaves, a rude shelter that faced the lagoon and seemed very near to falling down. He did not notice when Jack spoke.\n\n\u201cGot any water?\u201d\n\nRalph looked up, frowning, from the complication of leaves. He did not notice Jack even when he saw him.\n\n\u201cI said have you got any water? I'm thirsty.\u201d\n\nRalph withdrew his attention from the shelter and realized Jack with a start.\n\n\u201cOh, hullo. Water? There by the tree. Ought to be some left.\u201d\nJack took up a coconut shell that brimmed with fresh water from among a group that was arranged in the shade, and drank. The water splashed over his chin and neck and chest. He breathed noisily when he had finished.\n\n\u201cNeeded that.\u201d\n\n\nSimon spoke from inside the shelter.\n\n\u201cUp a bit.\u201d\n\nRalph turned to the shelter and lifted a branch with a whole tiling of leaves.\n\nThe leaves came apart and fluttered down. Simon\u201fs contrite face appeared in the hole.\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\nRalph surveyed the wreck with distaste.\n\n\u201cNever get it done.\u201d\n\nHe flung himself down at Jack\u201fs feet Simon remained, looking out of the hole in the shelter. Once down, Ralph explained.\n\n\u201cBeen working for days now. And look!\u201d\n\nTwo shelters were in position, but shaky. This one was a ruin.\n\n\u201cAnd they keep running off. You remember the meeting? How everyone was going to work hard until the shelters were finished?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept me and my hunters-\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept the hunters. Well, the littluns are-\u201d\n\nHe gesticulated, sought for a word.\n\n\u201cThey're hopeless. The older ones aren't much better. D'you see? All day I've been working with Simon. No one else. They\u201fre off bathing, or eating, or playing.\u201d\n\nSimon poked his head out carefully.\n\n\u201cYou're chief. You tell 'em off.\u201d\n\nRalph lay flat and looked up at the palm trees and the sky.\n\n\u201cMeetings. Don't we love meetings? Every day. Twice a day. We talk.\u201d He got on one elbow. \u201cI bet if I blew the conch this minute, they'd come running. Then we\u201fd be, you know, very solemn, and someone would say we ought to build a jet, or a submarine, or a TV set. When the meeting was over they\u201fd work for five minutes, then wander off or go hunting.\u201d\n\nJack flushed.\n\n\u201cWe want meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we haven\u201ft got any yet. And we want shelters. Besides, the rest of your hunters came back hours ago. They've been swimming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went on,\u201d said Jack. \u201cI let them go. I had to go on. I-\u201d\n\nHe tried to convey the compulsion to track down and kill that was swallowing him up.\n\n\u201cI went on. I thought, by myself-\u201d\n\nThe madness came into his eyes again.\n\n\u201cI thought I might kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you didn't.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I might.\u201d\n\nSome hidden passion vibrated in Ralph\u201fs voice.\n\n\u201cBut you haven\u201ft yet.\u201d\n\nHis invitation might have passed as casual, were it not for the undertone.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn't care to help with the shelters, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want meat-\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we don't get it.\u201d\n\nNow the antagonism was audible.\n\n\u201cBut I shall! Next time! I've got to get a barb on this spear! We wounded a pig and the spear fell out. If we could only make barbs-\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need shelters.\u201d\n\nSuddenly Jack shouted in rage.\n\n\u201cAre you accusing-?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I\u201fm saying is we've worked dashed hard. That's all.\u201d\n\nThey were both red in the face and found looking at each other difficult. Ralph rolled on his stomach and began to play with the grass.\n\n\u201cIf it rains like when we dropped in we'll need shelters all right. And then another thing. We need shelters because of the-\u201d\n\nHe paused for a moment and they both pushed their anger away. Then he went on with the safe, changed subject.\n\n\u201cYou've noticed, haven't you?\u201d\n\nJack put down his spear and squatted.\n\n\"Noticed what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell. They're frightened.\u201d\n\nHe rolled over and peered into Jack's fierce, dirty face.\n\n\u201cI mean the way things are. They dream. You can hear 'em. Have you been awake at night?\u201d\n\nJack shook his head.\n\n\u201cThey talk and scream. The littluns. Even some of the others. As if-\u201d\n\n\u201cAs if it wasn't a good island.\u201d.\n\nAstonished at the interruption, they looked up at Simon's serious face.\n\n\u201cAs if,\u201d said Simon, \u201cthe beastie, the beastie or the snake-thing, was real. Remember?\u201d\n\nThe two older boys flinched when they heard the shameful syllable. Snakes were not mentioned now, were not mentionable.\n\n\u201cAs if this wasn't a good island,\u201d said Ralph slowly. \u201cYes, that\u201fs right.\u201d\n\nJack sat up and stretched out his legs.\n\n\u201cCrackers. Remember when we went exploring?\u201d\n\nThey grinned at each other, remembering the glamour of the first day. Ralph went on.\n\n\u201cSo we need shelters as a sort of-\u201d\n\n\u201cHome.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's right.\u201d\n\nJack drew up his legs, clasped his knees, and frowned in an effort to attain clarity.\n\n\u201cAll the same-in the forest. I mean when you're hunting, not when you're getting fruit, of course, but when you're on your own-\u201d\n\nHe paused for a moment, not sure if Ralph would take him seriously.\n\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\n\"If you're hunting sometimes you catch yourself feeling as if-\" He flushed suddenly. \u201cThere's nothing in it of course. Just a feeling. But you can feel as if you're not hunting, but-being hunted, as if something's behind you all the time in the jungle.\u201d\n\nThey were silent again: Simon intent, Ralph incredulous and faintly indignant. He sat up, rubbing one shoulder with a dirty hand.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u201ft know.\u201d\n\nJack leapt to his feet and spoke very quickly.\n\n\u201cThat\u201fs how you can feel in the forest. Of course there\u201fs nothing in it. Only-only-\u201d\n\nHe took a few rapid steps toward the beach, then came back.\n\n\u201cOnly I know how they feel. See? That\u201fs all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best thing we can do is get ourselves rescued.\u201d\n\nJack had to think for a moment before he could remember what rescue was.\n\n\u201cRescue? Yes, of course! All the same, I\u201fd like to catch a pig first-\u201d\n\nHe snatched up his spear and dashed it into the: ground. The opaque, mad look came into his eyes again. Ralph looked at him critically through his tangle of fair hair.\n\n\u201cSo long as your hunters remember the fire-\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and your fire-\u201d\n\nThe two boys trotted down the beach, and, turning at the water\u201fs edge, looked back at the pink mountain. The trickle of smoke sketched a chalky line up the solid blue of the sky, wavered high up and faded. Ralph frowned.\n\n\u201cI wonder how far off you could see that\u201d\n\n\u201cMiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u201ft make enough smoke.\u201d\n\nThe bottom part of the trickle, as though conscious of their gaze, thickened to a creamy blur which crept up the feeble column.\n\n\u201cThey've put on green branches,\u201d muttered Ralph. \u201cI wonder!\u201d He screwed up his eyes and swung round to search the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it!\u201d\n\nJack shouted so loudly that Ralph jumped.\n\n\u201cWhat? Where? Is it a ship?\u201d\n\nBut Jack was pointing to the high declivities that led down from the mountain to the flatter part of the island.\n\n\u201cOf course! They'll Be up there-they must, when the sun\u201fs too hot-\u201d\n\nRalph gazed bewildered at his rapt face.\n\n\u201c-they get up high. High up and in the shade, resting during the heat, like cows at home-\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you saw a ship!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could steal up on one-paint our faces so they wouldn't see-perhaps surround them and then-\u201d\n\nIndignation took away Ralph's control.\n\n\u201cI was talking about smoke! Don\u201ft you want to be rescued? All you can talk about is pig, pig, pig!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we want meat!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I work all day with nothing but Simon and you come back and don\u201ft even notice the huts!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was working too-\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you like it!\u201d shouted Ralph. \u201cYou want to hunt! While I-\u201d\n\nThey faced each other on the bright beach, astonished at the rub of feeling. Ralph looked away first, pretending interest in a group of littluns on the sand. From beyond the platform came the shouting of the hunters in the swimming pool. On the end of the platform Piggy was lying flat, looking down into the brilliant water.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u201ft help much.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to explain how people were never quite what you thought they were.\n\n\u201cSimon. He helps.\u201d He pointed at the shelters.\n\n\u201cAll the rest rushed off. He\u201fs done as much as I have. Only-\u201d\n\n\u201cSimon\u201fs always about.\u201d\n\nRalph started back to the shelters with Jack by his side.\n\n\u201cDo a bit for you,\u201d muttered Jack, \u201cbefore I have a bathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u201ft bother.\u201d\n\nBut when they reached the shelters Simon was not to be seen. Ralph put his head in the hole, withdrew it, and turned to Jack.\n\n\u201cHe\u201fs buzzed off.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot fed up,\u201d said Jack, \u201cand gone for a bathe.\u201d\n\nRalph frowned.\n\n\u201cHe\u201fs queer. He\u201fs funny.\u201d\n\nJack nodded, as much for the sake of agreeing as anything, and by tacit consent they left the shelter and went toward the bathing pool.\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d said Jack, \u201cwhen I've had a bathe and something to eat, I'll just trek over to the other side of the mountain and see if I can see any traces. Coming?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the sun\u201fs nearly set!\u201d\n\n\u201cI might have time-\u201d\n\nThey walked along, two continents of experience and feeling, unable to communicate.\n\n\u201cIf I could only get a pig!\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll come back and go on with the shelter.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other, baffled, in love and hate. All the warm salt water of the bathing pool and the shouting and splashing and laughing were only just sufficient to bring them together again.\nSimon was not in the bathing pool as they had expected.\nWhen the other two had trotted down the beach to look back at the mountain he had followed them for a few yards and then stopped. He had stood frowning down at a pile of sand on the beach where somebody had been trying to build a little house or hut Then he turned his back on this and walked into the forest with an air of purpose. He was a small, skinny boy, his chin pointed, and his eyes so bright they had deceived Ralph into thinking him delightfully gay and wicked. The coarse mop of black hair was long and swung down, almost concealing a low, broad forehead. He wore the remains of shorts and his feet were bare like Jack\u201fs. Always darkish in color, Simon was burned by the sun to a deep tan that glistened with sweat.\n\nHe picked his way up the scar, passed the great rock where Ralph had climbed on the first morning, then turned off to his right among the trees. He walked with an accustomed tread through the acres of fruit trees, where the least energetic could find an easy if unsatisfying meal. Flower and fruit grew together on the same tree and everywhere was the scent of ripeness and the booming of a million bees at pasture. Here the littlums who had run after him caught up with him. They talked, cried out unintelligibly, lugged him toward the trees. Then, amid the roar of bees in the afternoon sunlight, Simon found for them the fruit they could not reach, pulled off the choicest from up in the foliage, passed them back down to the endless, outstretched hands. When he had satisfied them he paused and looked round. The littluns watched him inscrutably over double handfuls of ripe fruit.\n\nSimon turned away from them and went where the just perceptible path led him. Soon high jungle closed in. Tall trunks bore unexpected pale flowers all the way up to the dark canopy where life went on clamorously. The air here was dark too, and the creepers dropped their ropes like the rigging of foundered ships. His feet left prints in the soft soil and the creepers shivered throughout their lengths when he bumped them.\n\nHe came at last to a place where more sunshine fell. Since they had not so far to go for light the creepers had woven a great mat that hung at the side of an open space in the jungle; for here a patch of rock came close to the surface and would not allow more than little plants and ferns to grow. The whole space was walled with dark aromatic bushes, and was a bowl of heat and light. A great tree, fallen across one corner, leaned against the trees that still stood arid a rapid climber flaunted red and yellow sprays right to the top.\n\nSimon paused. He looked over his shoulder as Jack had done at the close ways behind him and glanced swiftly round to confirm that he was utterly alone. For a moment his movements were almost furtive. Then he bent down and wormed his way into the center of the mat. The creepers and the bushes were so close that he left his sweat on them and they pulled together behind him. When he was secure in the middle he was in a little cabin screened off from the open space by a few leaves. He squatted down, parted the leaves arid looked out into the clearing. Nothing moved but a pair of gaudy butterflies that danced round each other in the hot air. Holding his breath he cocked a critical ear at the sounds of the island. Evening was advancing toward the island; the sounds of the bright fantastic birds, the bee-sounds, even the crying of the gulls that were returning to their roosts among the square rocks, were fainter. The deep sea breaking miles away on the reef made an undertone less perceptible than the susurration of the blood.\n\nSimon dropped the screen of leaves back into place. The slope of the bars of honey-colored sunlight decreased; they slid up the bushes, passed over the green candle-like buds, moved up toward tile canopy, and darkness thickened under the trees. With the fading of the light the riotous colors died and the heat and urgency cooled away. The candle-buds stirred. Their green sepals drew back a little and the white tips of the flowers rose delicately to meet the open air.\n\nNow the sunlight had lifted clear of the open space and withdrawn from the sky. Darkness poured out, submerging the ways between the trees tin they were dim and strange as the bottom of the sea. The candle-buds opened their wide white flowers glimmering under the light that pricked down from the first stars. Their scent spilled out into the air and took possession of the island.",de="The first rhythm that they became used to was the slow swing from dawn to quick dusk. They accepted the pleasures of morning, the bright sun, the whelming sea and sweet air, as a time when play was good and life so full that hope was not necessary and therefore forgotten. Toward noon, as the floods of light fell more nearly to the perpendicular, the stark colors\nof the morning were smoothed in pearl and opalescence; and the heat\u2014as though the impending sun\u2019s height gave it momentum\u2014became a blow that they ducked, running to the shade and lying there, perhaps even sleeping. Strange things happened at midday. The glittering sea rose up, moved\napart in planes of blatant impossibility; the coral reef and the few stunted palms that clung to the more elevated parts would float up into the sky, would quiver, be plucked apart, run like raindrops on a wire or be repeated as in an odd succession of mirrors. Sometimes land loomed where there was no land and flicked out like a bubble as the children watched. Piggy discounted all this learnedly as a \u201cmirage\u201d; and since no boy could reach even the reef over the stretch of water where the snapping sharks waited, they grew accustomed to these mysteries and ignored them, just as they ignored the miraculous, throbbing stars. At midday the illusions\nmerged into the sky and there the sun gazed down like an angry eye. Then, at the end of the afternoon; the mirage subsided and the horizon became level and blue and clipped as the sun declined. That was another time of comparative coolness but menaced by the coming of the dark. When the sun sank, darkness dropped on the island like an extinguisher\nand soon the shelters were full of restlessness, under the remote stars.\n\nNevertheless, the northern European tradition of work, play, and food right through the day, made it possible for them to adjust themselves wholly to this new rhythm. The littlun Percival had early crawled into a shelter and stayed there for two days, talking, singing, and crying, till they thought him batty and were faintly amused. Ever since then he had\nbeen peaked, red-eyed, and miserable; a littlun who played little and cried often.\n\nThe smaller boys were known now by the generic title of \u201clittluns.\u201d The decrease in size, from Ralph down, was gradual; and though there was a dubious region inhabited by Simon and Robert and Maurice, nevertheless no one had any difficulty in recognizing biguns at one end and littluns at the other. The undoubted littluns, those aged about six, led a quite\ndistinct, and at the same time intense, life of their own. They ate most of the day, picking fruit where they could reach it and not particular about ripeness and quality. They were used now to stomach-aches and a sort of chronic diarrhoea. They suffered untold terrors in the dark and huddled\ntogether for comfort. Apart from food and sleep, they found time for play, aimless and trivial, in the white sand by the bright water. They cried for their mothers much less often than might have been expected; they were very brown, and filthily dirty. They obeyed the summons of the conch, partly because Ralph blew it, and he was big enough to be a\nlink with the adult world of authority; and partly because they enjoyed the entertainment of the assemblies. But otherwise they seldom bothered with the biguns and their passionately emotional and corporate life was their own.\n\nThey had built castles in the sand at the bar of the little river. These castles were about one foot high and were decorated with shells, withered flowers, and interesting stones. Round the castles was a complex of marks, tracks, walls, railway lines, that were of significance only if inspected with the eye at beach-level. The littluns played here, if not happily at least with absorbed attention; and often as many as three of them would play the same game together.\n\nThree were playing here now. Henry was the biggest of them. He was also a distant relative of that other boy whose mulberry-marked face had not been seen since the evening of the great fire; but he was not old enough to understand this, and if he had been told that the other boy had gone home in an aircraft, he would have accepted the statement without\nfuss or disbelief.\n\nHenry was a bit of a leader this afternoon, because the other two were Percival and Johnny, the smallest boys on the island. Percival was mousecolored and had not been very attractive even to his mother; Johnny was well built, with fair hair and a natural belligerence. Just now he was being obedient because he was interested; and the three children, kneeling in the sand, were at peace. Roger and Maurice came out of the forest. They were relieved from duty at the fire and had come down for a swim. Roger led the way straight through the castles, kicking them over, burying the flowers, scattering the chosen stones. Maurice followed, laughing, and added to the destruction. The three littluns paused in their game and looked up. As it happened, the particular marks in which they were interested had not been touched, so they made no protest. Only Percival began to whimper with an eyeful of sand and Maurice hurried away. In his other life Maurice had received chastisement for filling a younger eye with sand. Now, though there was no parent to let fall a heavy hand, Maurice still felt the unease of wrongdoing. At the back of his mind formed the uncertain outlines of an excuse. He muttered something about a swim and broke into a trot.\n\nRoger remained, watching the littluns. He was not noticeably darker than when he had dropped in, but the shock of black hair, down his nape and low on his forehead, seemed to suit his gloomy face and made what had seemed at first an unsociable remoteness into something forbidding.\nPercival finished his whimper and went on playing, for the tears had washed the sand away. Johnny watched him with china-blue eyes; then began to fling up sand in a shower, and presently Percival was crying again. When Henry tired of his play and wandered off along the beach, Roger followed him, keeping beneath the palms and drifting casually in the same direction. Henry walked at a distance from the palms and the shade because he was too young to keep himself out of the sun. He went down the beach and busied himself at the water\u2019s edge. The great Pacific tide was coming in and every few seconds the relatively still water of the lagoon heaved forwards an inch. There were creatures that lived in this last\nfling of the sea, tiny transparencies that came questing in with the water over the hot, dry sand. With impalpable organs of sense they examined this new field. Perhaps food had appeared where at the last incursion there had been none; bird droppings, insects perhaps, any of the strewn detritus of landward life. Like a myriad of tiny teeth in a saw, the transparencies came scavenging over the beach.\n\nThis was fascinating to Henry. He poked about with a bit of stick, that itself was wave-worn and whitened and a vagrant, and tried to control the motions of the scavengers. He made little runnels that the tide filled and tried to crowd them with creatures. He became absorbed beyond mere happiness as he felt himself exercising control over living things. He talked to them, urging them, ordering them. Driven back by the tide,\nhis footprints became bays in which they were trapped and gave him the illusion of mastery. He squatted on his hams at the water\u2019s edge, bowed, with a shock of hair falling over his forehead and past his eyes, and the afternoon sun emptied down invisible arrows.\n\nRoger waited too. At first he had hidden behind a great palm; but Henry\u2019s absorption with the transparencies was so obvious that at last he stood out in full view. He looked along the beach. Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles, He sat there, crooning to himself and throwing sand at an imaginary Percival.\nBeyond him, Roger could see the platform and the glints of spray where Ralph and Simon and Piggy and Maurice were diving in the pool. He listened carefully but could only just hear them.\n\nA sudden breeze shook the fringe of palm trees, so that the fronds tossed and fluttered. Sixty feet above Roger, several nuts, fibrous lumps as big as rugby balls, were loosed from their stems. They fell about him with a series of hard thumps and he was not touched. Roger did not consider his escape, but looked from the nuts to Henry and back again.\n\nThe subsoil beneath the palm trees was a raised beach, and generations of palms had worked loose in this the stones that had lain on the sands of another shore. Roger stooped, picked up a stone, aimed, and threw it at Henry\u2014 threw it to miss. The stone, that token of preposterous time, bounced five yards to Henry\u2019s right and fell in the water. Roger gathered a\nhandful of stones and began to throw them. Yet there was a space round Henry, perhaps six yards in diameter, into which he dare not throw. Here, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old life. Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law. Roger\u2019s arm was conditioned by a civilization that knew nothing of\nhim and was in ruins.\n\nHenry was surprised by the plopping sounds in the water. He abandoned the noiseless transparencies and pointed at the center of the spreading rings like a setter. This side and that the stones fell, and Henry turned obediently but always too late to see the stones in the air. At last he saw one and laughed, looking for the friend who was teasing him. But\nRoger had whipped behind the palm again, was leaning against it breathing quickly, his eyelids fluttering. Then Henry lost interest in stones and wandered off.\n\u201cRoger.\u201d\nJack was standing under a tree about ten yards away. When Roger opened his eyes and saw him, a darker shadow crept beneath the swarthiness of his skin; but Jack noticed nothing. He was eager, impatient, beckoning, so that Roger went to him.\n\nThere was a small pool at the end of the river, dammed back by sand and full of white water-lilies and needle-like reeds. Here Sam and Eric were waiting, and Bill. Jack, concealed from the sun, knelt by the pool and opened the two large leaves that he carried. One of them contained white clay, and the other red. By them lay a stick of charcoal brought down from the fire.\n\nJack explained to Roger as he worked.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t smell me. They see me, I think. Something pink, under the trees.\u201d\nHe smeared on the clay.\n\u201cIf only I\u2019d some green!\u201d\nHe turned a half-concealed face up to Roger and answered the incomprehension of his gaze.\n\u201cFor hunting. Like in the war. You know\u2014dazzle paint. Like things trying to look like something else\u2014\u201d He twisted in the urgency of telling. \u201c\u2014like moths on a tree trunk.\u201d\nRoger understood and nodded gravely. The twins moved toward Jack and began to protest timidly about something. Jack waved them away.\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\nHe rubbed the charcoal stick between the patches of red and white on his face.\n\u201cNo. You two come with me.\u201d\nHe peered at his reflection and disliked it. He bent down, took up a double handful of lukewarm water and rubbed the mess from his face. Freckles and sandy eyebrows appeared.\nRoger smiled, unwillingly.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t half look a mess.\u201d\nJack planned his new face. He made one cheek and one eye-socket white, then he rubbed red over the other half of his face and slashed a black bar of charcoal across from right ear to left jaw. He looked in the pool for his reflection, but his breathing troubled the mirror.\n\u201cSamneric. Get me a coconut. An empty one.\u201d\nHe knelt, holding the shell of water. A rounded patch of sunlight fell on his face and a brightness appeared in the depths of the water. He looked in astonishment, no longer at himself but at an awesome stranger. He spilt the water and leapt to his feet, laughing excitedly. Beside the pool his sinewy body held up a mask that drew their eyes and appalled them.\nHe began to dance and his laughter became a bloodthirsty snarling. He capered toward Bill, and the mask was a thing on its own, behind which Jack hid, liberated from shame and self-consciousness. The face of red and white and black swung through the air and jigged toward Bill. Bill started up laughing; then suddenly he fell silent and blundered away through the bushes.\nJack rushed toward the twins.\n\u201cThe rest are making a line. Come on!\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014we\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCome on! I\u2019ll creep up and stab\u2014\u201d\nThe mask compelled them.\n\nRalph climbed out of the bathing pool and trotted up the beach and sat in the shade beneath the palms. His fair hair was plastered over his eyebrows and he pushed it back. Simon was floating in the water and kicking with his feet, and Maurice was practising diving. Piggy was mooning about, aimlessly picking up things and discarding them. The rock-pools which so fascinated him were covered by the tide, so he was without an interest until the tide went back. Presently, seeing Ralph under the palms, he came and sat by him.\n\nPiggy wore the remainders of a pair of shorts, his fat body was golden brown, and the glasses still flashed when he looked at anything. He was the only boy on the island whose hair never seemed to grow. The rest were shock-headed, but Piggy\u2019s hair still lay in wisps over his head as though baldness were his natural state and this imperfect covering would soon go, like the velvet on a young stag\u2019s antlers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cabout a clock. We could make a sundial. We could put a stick in the sand, and then\u2014\u201d\nThe effort to express the mathematical processes involved was too great. He made a few passes instead.\n\u201cAnd an air-plane, and a TV set,\u201d said Ralph sourly, \u201cand a steam engine.\u201d\nPiggy shook his head.\n\u201cYou have to have a lot of metal things for that,\u201d he said, \u201cand we haven\u2019t got no metal. But we got a stick.\u201d\n\nRalph turned and smiled involuntarily. Piggy was a bore; his fat, his ass-mar and his matter-of-fact ideas were dull, but there was always a little pleasure to be got out of pulling his leg, even if one did it by accident.\n\nPiggy saw the smile and misinterpreted it as friendliness. There had grown up tacitly among the biguns the opinion that Piggy was an outsider, not only by accent, which did not matter, but by fat, and ass-mar, and specs, and a certain disinclination for manual labor. Now, finding that something he had said made Ralph smile, he rejoiced and pressed his\nadvantage.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of sticks. We could have a sundial each. Then we should know what the time was.\u201d\n\u201cA fat lot of good that would be.\u201d\n\u201cYou said you wanted things done. So as we could be rescued.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d\nHe leapt to his feet and trotted back to the pool, just as Maurice did a rather poor dive. Ralph was glad of a chance to change the subject. He shouted as Maurice came to the surface.\n\u201cBelly flop! Belly flop!\u201d\nMaurice flashed a smile at Ralph who slid easily into the water. Of all the boys, he was the most at home there; but today, irked by the mention of rescue, the useless, footling mention of rescue, even the green depths of water and the shattered, golden sun held no balm. Instead of remaining and playing, he swam with steady strokes under Simon and crawled out of the other side of the pool to lie there, sleek and streaming like a seal. Piggy, always clumsy, stood up and came to stand by him, so that Ralph rolled on his stomach and pretended not to see. The mirages had died away and gloomily he ran his eye along the taut blue line of the horizon.\nThe next moment he was on his feet and shouting.\n\n\u201cSmoke! Smoke!\u201d\nSimon tried to sit up in the water and got a mouthful. Maurice, who had been standing ready to dive, swayed back on his heels, made a bolt for the platform, then swerved back to the grass under the palms. There he started to pull on his tattered shorts, to be ready for anything.\n\nRalph stood, one hand holding back his hair, the other clenched. Simon was climbing out of the water. Piggy was rubbing his glasses on his shorts and squinting at the sea. Maurice had got both legs through one leg of his shorts. Of all the boys, only Ralph was still.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see no smoke,\u201d said Piggy incredulously. \u201cI can\u2019t see no smoke, Ralph\u2014where is it?\u201d\nRalph said nothing. Now both his hands were clenched over his forehead so that the fair hair was kept out of his eyes. He was leaning forward and already the salt was whitening his body.\n\u201cRalph\u2014where\u2019s the ship?\u201d\nSimon stood by, looking from Ralph to the horizon. Maurice\u2019s trousers gave way with a sigh and he abandoned them as a wreck, rushed toward the forest, and then came back again.\nThe smoke was a tight little knot on the horizon and was uncoiling slowly. Beneath the smoke was a dot that might be a funnel. Ralph\u2019s face was pale as he spoke to himself.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll see our smoke.\u201d\nPiggy was looking in the right direction now.\n\u201cIt don\u2019t look much.\u201d\nHe turned round and peered up at the mountain. Ralph continued to watch the ship, ravenously. Color was coming back into his face. Simon stood by him, silent.\n\u201cI know I can\u2019t see very much,\u201d said Piggy, \u201cbut have we got any smoke?\u201d\nRalph moved impatiently, still watching the ship.\n\u201cThe smoke on the mountain.\u201d\nMaurice came running, and stared out to sea. Both Simon and Piggy were looking up at the mountain. Piggy screwed up his face but Simon cried out as though he had hurt himself.\n\u201cRalph! Ralph!\u201d\nThe quality of his speech twisted Ralph on the sand.\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d said Piggy anxiously. \u201cIs there a signal?\u201d\nRalph looked back at the dispersing smoke in the horizon, then up at the mountain.\n\u201cRalph\u2014please! Is there a signal?\u201d\nSimon put out his hand, timidly, to touch Ralph; but Ralph started to run, splashing through the shallow end of the bathing pool, across the hot, white sand and under the palms. A moment later he was battling with the complex undergrowth that was already engulfing the scar. Simon\nran after him, then Maurice. Piggy shouted.\n\u201cRalph! Please\u2014Ralph!\u201d\nThen he too started to run, stumbling over Maurice\u2019s discarded shorts before he was across the terrace. Behind the four boys, the smoke moved gently along the horizon; and on the beach, Henry and Johnny were throwing sand at Percival who was crying quietly again; and all three were in complete ignorance of the excitement.\n\nBy the time Ralph had reached the landward end of the scar he was using precious breath to swear. He did desperate violence to his naked body among the rasping creepers so that blood was sliding over him. Just where the steep ascent of the mountain began, he stopped. Maurice was\nonly a few yards behind him.\n\u201cPiggy\u2019s specs!\u201d shouted Ralph. \u201cIf the fire\u2019s all out, we\u2019ll need them\u2014\u201d\nHe stopped shouting and swayed on his feet. Piggy was only just visible, bumbling up from the beach. Ralph looked at the horizon, then up to the mountain. Was it better to fetch Piggy\u2019s glasses, or would the ship have gone? Or if they climbed on, supposing the fire was all out, and they had to watch Piggy crawling nearer and the ship sinking under the horizon? Balanced on a high peak of need, agonized by indecision, Ralph\ncried out:\n\u201cOh God, oh God!\u201d\nSimon, struggling with the bushes, caught his breath. His face was twisted. Ralph blundered on, savaging himself, as the wisp of smoke moved on.\n\nThe fire was dead. They saw that straight away; saw what they had really known down on the beach when the smoke of home had beckoned. The fire was out, smokeless and dead; the watchers were gone. A pile of unused fuel lay ready.\n\nRalph turned to the sea. The horizon stretched, impersonal once more, barren of all but the faintest trace of smoke. Ralph ran stumbling along the rocks, saved himself on the edge of the pink cliff, and screamed at the ship.\n\u201cCome back! Come back!\u201d\nHe ran backwards and forwards along the cliff, his face always to the sea, and his voice rose insanely.\n\u201cCome back! Come back!\u201d\nSimon and Maurice arrived. Ralph looked at them with unwinking eyes. Simon turned away, smearing the water from his cheeks. Ralph reached inside himself for the worst word he knew.\n\u201cThey let the bloody fire go out.\u201d\nHe looked down the unfriendly side of the mountain. Piggy arrived, out of breath and whimpering like a littlun. Ralph clenched his fist and very red. The intentness of his gaze, the bitterness of his voice, pointed for him.\n\u201cThere they are.\u201d\nA procession had appeared, far down among the pink stones that lay near the water\u2019s edge. Some of the boys wore black caps but otherwise they were almost naked. They lifted sticks in the air together whenever they came to an easy patch. They were chanting, something to do with the bundle that the errant twins carried so carefully. Ralph picked out Jack easily, even at that distance, tall, red-haired, and inevitably leading\nthe procession.\n\nSimon looked now, from Ralph to Jack, as he had looked from Ralph to the horizon, and what he saw seemed to make him afraid. Ralph said nothing more, but waited while the procession came nearer. The chant was audible but at that distance still wordless. Behind Jack walked the twins, carrying a great stake on their shoulders. The gutted carcass of a\npig swung from the stake, swinging heavily as the twins toiled over the uneven ground. The pig\u2019s head hung down with gaping neck and seemed to search for something on the ground. At last the words of the chant floated up to them, across the bowl of blackened wood and ashes.\n\u201cKill the pig. Cut her throat. Spill her blood.\u201d\nYet as the words became audible, the procession reached the steepest part of the mountain, and in a minute or two the chant had died away. Piggy snivelled and Simon shushed him quickly as though he had spoken too loudly in church.\n\nJack, his face smeared with clays, reached the top first and hailed Ralph excitedly, with lifted spear.\n\u201cLook! We\u2019ve killed a pig\u2014we stole up on them\u2014we got in a circle\u2014\u201d\nVoices broke in from the hunters.\n\u201cWe got in a circle\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe crept up\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe pig squealed\u2014\u201d\n\nThe twins stood with the pig swinging between them, dropping black gouts on the rock. They seemed to share one wide, ecstatic grin. Jack had too many things to tell Ralph at once. Instead, he danced a step or two, then remembered his dignity and stood still, grinning. He noticed blood on his hands and grimaced distastefully, looked for something. Ralph spoke.\n\u201cYou let the fire go out.\u201d\nJack checked, vaguely irritated by this irrelevance but too happy to let it worry him.\n\u201cWe can light the fire again. You should have been with us, Ralph. We had a smashing time. The twins got knocked over\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe hit the pig\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014I fell on top\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI cut the pig\u2019s throat,\u201d said Jack, proudly, and yet twitched as he said it.\n\u201cCan I borrow yours, Ralph, to make a nick in the hilt?\u201d\nThe boys chattered and danced. The twins continued to grin.\n\u201cThere was lashings of blood,\u201d said Jack, laughing and shuddering, \u201cyou should have seen it!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go hunting every day\u2014\u201d\nRalph spoke again, hoarsely. He had not moved.\n\u201cYou let the fire go out.\u201d\nThis repetition made Jack uneasy. He looked at the twins and then back at Ralph.\n\u201cWe had to have them in the hunt,\u201d he said, \u201cor there wouldn\u2019t have been enough for a ring.\u201d\nHe flushed, conscious of a fault.\n\u201cThe fire\u2019s only been out an hour or two. We can light up again\u2014\u201d\nHe noticed Ralph\u2019s scarred nakedness, and the sombre silence of all four of them. He sought, charitable in his happiness, to include them in the thing that had happened. His mind was crowded with memories; memories of the knowledge that had come to them when they closed in on the struggling pig, knowledge that they had outwitted a living thing, imposed their will upon it, taken away its life like a long satisfying drink. He spread his arms wide.\n\u201cYou should have seen the blood!\u201d\nThe hunters were more silent now, but at this they buzzed again. Ralph flung back his hair. One arm pointed at the empty horizon. His voice was\u201cYou could have had everyone when the shelters were finished. But you had to hunt\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe needed meat.\u201d\nJack stood up as he said this, the bloodied knife in his hand. The two boys faced each other. There was the brilliant world of hunting, tactics, fierce exhilaration, skill; and there was the world of longing and baffled commonsense. Jack transferred the knife to his left hand and smudged blood over his forehead as he pushed down the plastered hair.\nPiggy began again.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t ought to have let that fire out. You said you\u2019d keep the smoke going\u2014\u201d\nThis from Piggy, and the wails of agreement from some of the hunters, drove Jack to violence. The bolting look came into his blue eyes. He took a step, and able at last to hit someone, stuck his fist into Piggy\u2019s stomach. Piggy sat down with a grunt. Jack stood over him. His voice was vicious with humiliation.\n\u201cYou would, would you? Fatty!\u201d\nRalph made a step forward and Jack smacked Piggy\u2019s head. Piggy\u2019s glasses flew off and tinkled on the rocks. Piggy cried out in terror:\n\u201cMy specs!\u201d\nHe went crouching and feeling over the rocks but Simon, who got there first, found them for him. Passions beat about Simon on the mountain-top with awful wings.\n\n\u201cOne side\u2019s broken.\u201d\nPiggy grabbed and put on the glasses. He looked malevolently at Jack.\n\u201cI got to have them specs. Now I only got one eye. Jus\u2019 you wait\u2014\u201d\nJack made a move toward Piggy who scrambled away till a great rock lay between them. He thrust his head over the top and glared at Jack through his one flashing glass.\n\u201cNow I only got one eye. Just you wait\u2014\u201d\nJack mimicked the whine and scramble.\n\u201cJus\u2019 you wait\u2014yah!\u201d\nPiggy and the parody were so funny that the hunters began to laugh. Jack felt encouraged. He went on scrambling and the laughter rose to a gale of hysteria. Unwillingly Ralph felt his lips twitch; he was angry with himself for giving way. He muttered.\n\u201cThat was a dirty trick.\u201d\nJack broke out of his gyration and stood facing Ralph. His words came in a shout.\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d\nHe looked at Piggy, at the hunters, at Ralph.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. About the fire, I mean. There. I\u2014\u201d\nHe drew himself up.\n\u201c\u2014I apologize.\u201d\n\nThe buzz from the hunters was one of admiration at this handsome behavior. Clearly they were of the opinion that Jack had done the decent thing, had put himself in the right by his generous apology and Ralph, obscurely, in the wrong. They waited for an appropriately decent answer.\n\nYet Ralph\u2019s throat refused to pass one. He resented, as an addition to Jack\u2019s misbehavior, this verbal trick. The fire was dead, the ship was gone. Could they not see? Anger instead of decency passed his throat.\n\u201cThat was a dirty trick.\u201d\nThey were silent on the mountain-top while the opaque look appeared in Jack\u2019s eyes and passed away. Ralph\u2019s final word was an ingracious mutter.\n\u201cAll right. Light the fire.\u201d\nWith some positive action before them, a little of the tension died. Ralph said no more, did nothing, stood looking down at the ashes round his feet. Jack was loud and active. He gave orders, sang, whistled, threw remarks at the silent Ralph\u2014remarks that did not need an answer, and therefore could not invite a snub; and still Ralph was silent. No one, not even Jack, would ask him to move and in the end they had to build the fire three yards away and in a place not really as convenient.\n\nSo Ralph asserted his chieftainship and could not have chosen a better way if he had thought for days. Against this weapon, so indefinable and so effective, Jack was powerless and raged without knowing why. By the time the pile was built, they were on different sides of a high barrier.\n\nWhen they had dealt with the fire another crisis arose. Jack had no means of lighting it. Then to his surprise, Ralph went to Piggy and took the glasses from him. Not even Ralph knew how a link between him and Jack had been snapped and fastened elsewhere.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring \u2019em back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come too.\u201d\nPiggy stood behind him, islanded in a sea of meaningless color, while Ralph knelt and focused the glossy spot. Instantly the fire was alight, Piggy held out his hands and grabbed the glasses back.\n\nBefore these fantastically attractive flowers of violet and red and yellow, unkindness melted away. They became a circle of boys round a camp fire and even Piggy and Ralph were half-drawn in. Soon some of the boys were rushing down the slope for more wood while Jack hacked the pig. They tried holding the whole carcass on a stake over the fire, but the stake burnt more quickly than the pig roasted. In the end they skewered\nbits of meat on branches and held them in the flames: and even then almost as much boy was roasted as meat. Ralph\u2019s dribbled. He meant to refuse meat, but his past diet of fruit and nuts, with an odd crab or fish, gave him too little resistance. He accepted a piece of half-raw meat and gnawed it like a wolf. Piggy spoke, also dribbling.\n\u201cAren\u2019t I having none?\u201d\nJack had meant to leave him in doubt, as an assertion of power; but Piggy by advertising his omission made more cruelty necessary.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hunt.\u201d\n\u201cNo more did Ralph,\u201d said Piggy wetly, \u201cnor Simon.\u201d He amplified.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t more than a ha\u2019porth of meat in a crab.\u201d\nRalph stirred uneasily. Simon, sitting between the twins and Piggy, wiped his mouth and shoved his piece of meat over the rocks to Piggy, who grabbed it. The twins giggled and Simon lowered his face in shame.\nThen Jack leapt to his feet, slashed off a great hunk of meat, and flung it down at Simon\u2019s feet.\n\u201cEat! Damn you!\u201d\nHe glared at Simon.\n\u201cTake it!\u201d\nHe spun on his heel, center of a bewildered circle of boys.\n\u201cI got you meat!\u201d\nNumberless and inexpressible frustrations combined to make his rage elemental and awe-inspiring.\n\u201cI painted my face\u2014I stole up. Now you eat\u2014all of you\u2014and I\u2014\u201d\nSlowly the silence on the mountain-top deepened till the click of the fire and the soft hiss of roasting meat could be heard clearly. Jack looked round for understanding but found only respect. Ralph stood among the ashes of the signal fire, his hands full of meat, saying nothing. Then at last Maurice broke the silence. He changed the subject to the only one that could bring the majority of them together.\n\u201cWhere did you find the pig?\u201d\nRoger pointed down the unfriendly side.\n\u201cThey were there\u2014by the sea.\u201d\nJack, recovering could not bear to have his story told. He broke in quickly.\n\u201cWe spread round. I crept, on hands and knees. The spears fell out because they hadn\u2019t barbs on. The pig ran away and made an awful noise\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt turned back and ran into the circle, bleeding\u2014\u201d\nAll the boys were talking at once, relieved and excited.\n\u201cWe closed in\u2014\u201d\nThe first blow had paralyzed its hind quarters, so then the circle could close in and beat and beat\u2014\n\u201cI cut the pig\u2019s throat\u2014\u201d\nThe twins, still sharing their identical grin, jumped up and ran round each other. Then the rest joined in, making pig-dying noises and shouting.\n\u201cOne for his nob!\u201d\n\u201cGive him a fourpenny one!\u201d\nThen Maurice pretended to be the pig and ran squealing into the center, and the hunters, circling still, pretended to beat him. As they danced, they sang.\n\u201cKill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in.\u201d\nRalph watched them, envious and resentful. Not till they flagged and the chant died away, did he speak.\n\u201cI\u2019m calling an assembly.\u201d\n\nOne by one, they halted, and stood watching him.\n\u201cWith the conch. I\u2019m calling a meeting even if we have to go on into the dark. Down on the platform. When I blow it. Now.\u201d\nHe turned away and walked off, down the mountain.",le='The tide was coming in and there was only a narrow strip of firm beach between the water and the white, stumbling stuff near the palm terrace. Ralph chose the firm strip as a path because he needed to think; and only here could he allow his feet to move without having to watch them. Suddenly, pacing by the water, he was overcome with astonishment. He found himself understanding the wearisomeness of his life, where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of one\'s waking life was spent watching one\'s feet. He stopped, facing the strip; and remembering that first enthusiastic exploration as though it were part of a brighter childhood, he smiled jeeringly. He turned then and walked back towards the platform with the sun in his face. The time had come for the assembly and as he walked into the concealing splendours of the sunlight he went carefully over the points of the assembly, no chasing imaginary. . .\n\nHe lost himself in a maze of thoughts that were rendered vague by his lack of words to express them. Frowning, he tried again.\n\nThis meeting must not be fun, but business.\n\nAt that he walked faster, aware all at once of urgency and the declining sun and a little wind created by his speed that breathed about his face. This wind pressed his grey shirt against his chest so that he noticed - in this new mood of comprehension - how the folds were stiff like cardboard, and unpleasant; noticed too how the frayed edges of his shorts were making an uncomfortable, pink area on the front of his thighs. With a convulsion of the mind, Ralph discovered dirt and decay; understood how much he disliked perpetually flicking the tangled hair out of his eyes, and at last, when the sun was gone, rolling noisily to rest among dry leaves. At that, he began to trot.\n\nThe beach near the bathing-pool was dotted with groups of boys waiting for the assembly. They made way for him silently, conscious of his grim mood and the fault at the fire.\n\nThe place of assembly in which he stood was roughly a triangle; but irregular and sketchy, like everything they made. First there was the log on which he himself sat; a dead tree that must have been quite exceptionally big for the platform. Perhaps one of those legendary storms of the Pacific had shifted it here. This palm trunk lay parallel to the beach, so that when Ralph sat he faced the island but to the boys was a darkish figure against the shimmer of the lagoon. The two sides of the triangle of which the log was base were less evenly defined. On the right was a log polished by restless seats along the top, but not so large as the chief\'s and not so comfortable. On the left were four small logs, one of them - the furthest - lamentably springy. Assembly after assembly had broken up in laughter when someone had leaned too far back and the log had whipped and thrown half a dozen boys backwards into the grass. Yet now, he saw, no one had the wit - not himself nor Jack, nor Piggy - to bring a stone and wedge the thing. So they would continue enduring the ill-balanced twister, because, because. . . . Again he lost himself in deep waters.\n\nGrass has worn away in front of each trunk but grew tall and untrodden in the centre of the triangle. Then, at the apex, the grass was thick again because no one sat there. All around the place of assembly the grey trunks rose, straight or leaning, and supported the low roof of leaves. On two sides was the beach; behind, the lagoon; in front, the darkness of the island.\n\nRalph turned to the chief\'s seat. They had never had an assembly as late before. That was why the place looked so different. Normally the underside of the green roof was lit by a tangle of golden reflections, and their faces were lit upside down, like - thought Ralph, when you hold an electric torch in your hands. But now the sun was slanting in at one side, so that the shadows were here they ought to be.\n\nAgain he fell into that strange mood of speculation that was so foreign to him. If faces were different when lit from above or below - what was a face? What was anything?\n\nRalph moved impatiently. The trouble was, if you were a chief you had to think, you had to be wise. And then the occasion slipped by so that you had to grab at a decision. This made you think; because thought was a valuable thing, that got results. . .\n\nOnly, decided Ralph as he faced the chief\'s seat, I can\'t think. Not like Piggy.\n\nOnce more that evening, Ralph had to adjust his values. Piggy could think. He could go step by step inside that fat head of his, only Piggy was no chief. But Piggy, for all his ludicrous body, had brains. Ralph was a specialist in thought now, and could recognize thought in another.\n\nThe sun in his eyes reminded him how time was passing so he took the conch down from the tree and examined the surface. Exposure to the air had bleached the yellow and pink to near-white, and transparency. Ralph felt a kind of affectionate reverence for the conch, even though he had fished the thing out of the lagoon himself. He faced the place of assembly and put the conch to his lips.\n\nThe others were waiting for this and came straight away.\n\nThose who were aware that a ship had passed the island while the fire was out were subdued by the thought of Ralph\'s anger; while those, including the littluns who did not know, were impressed by the general air of solemnity. The place of assembly filled quickly; Jack, Simon, Maurice, most of the hunters, on Ralph\'s right; the rest on the left, under the sun. Piggy came and stood outside the triangle. This indicated that he wished to listen, but would not speak; and Piggy intended it as a gesture of disapproval.\n\n"The thing is: we need an assembly."\n\nNo one said anything but the faces turned to Ralph were intent. He flourished the conch. He had learnt as a practical business that fundamental statements like this had to be said at least twice, before everyone understood them. One had to sit, attracting all eyes to the conch, and drop words like heavy round stones among the little groups that crouched or squatted. He was searching his mind for simple words so that even the littluns would understand what the assembly was about. Later perhaps, practised debaters - Jack, Maurice, Piggy - would use their whole art to twist the meeting: but now at the beginning the subject of the debate must be laid out clearly.\n\n"We need an assembly. Not for fun. Not for laughing and falling off the log" - the group of littluns on the twister giggled and looked at each other - "not for making jokes, or for" - he lifted the conch in an effort to find the compelling word - "for cleverness. Not for these things. But to put things straight."\n\nHe paused for a moment.\n\n"I\'ve been along. By myself I went, thinking what\'s what. I know what we need. An assembly to put things straight. And first of all, I\'m speaking."\n\nHe paused for a moment and automatically pushed back his hair. Piggy tiptoed to the triangle, his ineffectual protest made, and joined the others.\n\nRalph went on.\n\n"We have lots of assemblies. Everybody enjoys speaking and being together. We decide things. But they don\'t get done. We were going to have water brought from the stream and left in those coco-nut shells under fresh leaves. So it was, for a few days. Now there\'s no water. The shells are dry. People drink from the river."\n\nThere was a murmur of assent.\n\n"Not that there\'s anything wrong with drinking from the river. I mean I\'d sooner have water from that place - you know - the pool where the waterfall is - than out of an old coco-nut shell. Only we said we\'d have the water brought. And not now. There were only two full shells there this afternoon."\n\nHe licked his lips.\n"Then there\'s huts. Shelters."\n\nThe murmur swelled again and died away.\n\n"You mostly sleep in shelters. To-night, except for Samneric up by the fire, you\'ll all sleep there. Who built the shelters?"\n\nClamour rose at once. Everyone had built the shelters.\n\nRalph had to wave the conch once more.\n\n"Wait a minute! I mean, who built all three? We all built the first one, four of us the second, and me \'n\' Simon built the last one over there. That\'s why it\'s so tottery. No. Don\'t laugh. That shelter might fall down if the rain comes back. We\'ll need those shelters then."\n\nHe paused and cleared his throat.\n\n"There\'s another thing. We chose those rocks right along beyond the bathing-pool as a lavatory. That was sensible too. The tide cleans the place up. You littluns know about that."\n\nThere were sniggers here and there and swift glances.\n\n"Now people seem to use everywhere. Even near the shelters and the platform. You littluns, when you\'re eating fruit; if you\'re taken short-"\n\nThe assembly roared.\n\n"I said if you\'re taken short you keep away from the fruit. That\'s dirty."\n\nLaughter rose again.\n"I said that\'s dirty."\n\nHe plucked at his stiff, grey shirt.\n\n"That\'s really dirty. If you\'re taken short you go right along the beach to the rocks. See?"\n\nPiggy held out his hands for the conch but Ralph shook his head. This speech was planned, point by point.\n\n"We\'ve all got to use the rocks again. This place is getting dirty." He paused. The assembly, sensing a crisis, was tensely expectant. "And then: about the fire."\n\nRalph let out his spare breath with a little gasp that was echoed by his audience. Jack started to chip a piece of wood with his knife and whispered something to Robert, who looked away.\n\n"The fire is the most important thing on the island. How can we ever be rescued except by luck, if we don\'t keep a fire going? Is a fire too much for us to make?"\n\nHe flung out his arm.\n\n"Look at us! How many are we? And yet we can\'t keep a fire going to make smoke. Don\'t you understand? Can\'t you see we ought to - ought to die before we let the fire out?"\n\nThere was a self-conscious giggling among the hunters.\nRalph turned on them passionately.\n\n"You hunters! You can laugh! But I tell you smoke is more important than the pig, however often you kill one. Do all of you see?" He spread his arms wide and turned to the whole triangle.\n\n"We\'ve got to make smoke up there - or die."\n\nHe paused, feeling for his next point.\n\n"And another thing."\n\nSomeone called out.\n\n"Too many things."\n\nThere came mutters of agreement. Ralph overrode them.\n\n"And another thing. We nearly set the whole island on fire. And we waste time, rolling rocks, and making little cooking fires. Now I say this and make it a rule, because I\'m chief. We won\'t have a fire anywhere but on the mountain. Ever."\n\nThere was a row immediately. Boys stood up and shouted and Ralph shouted back.\n\n"Because if you want a fire to cook fish or crab, you can jolly well go up the mountain. That way we\'ll be certain."\n\nHands were reaching for the conch in the light of the setting sun. He held on and leapt on the trunk.\n\n"All this I meant to say. Now I\'ve said it. You voted me for chief. Now you do what I say."\n\nThey quietened,y slowly, and at last were seated again. Ralph dropped down and spoke in his ordinary voice,\n\n"So remember. The rock are for a lavatory. Keep the fire going and smoke showing a signal. Don\'t take fire from the mountain. Take your food up there."\n\nJack stood up, scowling in the gloom, and held out his hands.\n\n"I haven\'t finished yet."\n\n"But you\'ve talked and talked!"\n\n"I\'ve got the conch."\n\nJack sat down, grumbling.\n\n"Then the last thing. This is what people can talk about."\n\nHe waited until the platform was very still.\n\n"Things are breaking up. I don\'t understand why. We began well; we were happy. And then-"\n\nHe moved the conch gently, looking beyond them at nothing, remembering the beastie, the snake, the fire, the talk of fear.\n\n"Then people started getting frightened."\n\nA murmur, almost a moan, rose and passed away. Jack had stopped whittling. Ralph went on, abruptly.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s littluns\u2019 talk. We\u2019ll get that straight. So the last part, the bit we can all talk about, is kind of deciding on the fear.\u201d\n\nThe hair was creeping into his eyes again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk about this fear and decide there\u2019s nothing in it. I\u2019m frightened myself, sometimes; only that\u2019s nonsense! Like bogies. Then, when we\u2019ve decided, we can start again and be careful about things like the fire.\u201d A picture of three boys walking along the bright beach flitted through his mind. \u201cAnd be happy.\u201d\n\nCeremonially, Ralph laid the conch on the trunk beside him as a sign that the speech was over. What sunlight reached them was level.\n\nJack stood up and took the conch.\n\n\u201cSo this is a meeting to find out what\u2019s what. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s what. You littluns started all this, with the fear talk. Beasts! Where from? Of course we\u2019re frightened sometimes but we put up with being frightened. Only Ralph says you scream in the night. What does that mean but nightmares? Anyway, you don\u2019t hunt or build or help\u2014you\u2019re a lot of cry-babies and sissies. That\u2019s what. And as for the fear\u2014you\u2019ll have to put up with that like the rest of us.\u201d\n\nRalph looked at Jack open-mouthed, but Jack took no notice.\n\n\u201cThe thing is\u2014fear can\u2019t hurt you any more than a dream. There aren\u2019t any beasts to be afraid of on this island.\u201d He looked along the row of whispering littluns. \u201cServe you right if something did get you, you useless lot of cry-babies! But there is no animal\u2014\u201d\n\nRalph interrupted him testily.\n\n\u201cWhat is all this? Who said anything about an animal?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did, the other day. You said they dream and cry out. Now they talk\u2014not only the littluns, but my hunters sometimes\u2014talk of a thing, a dark thing, a beast, some sort of animal. I\u2019ve heard. You thought not, didn\u2019t you? Now listen. You don\u2019t get big animals on small islands. Only pigs. You only get lions and tigers in big countries like Africa and India\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Zoo\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the conch. I\u2019m not talking about the fear. I\u2019m talking aboutthe beast. Be frightened if you like. But as for the beast\u2014\u201d\n\nJack paused, cradling the conch, and turned to his hunters with their dirty black caps.\n\n\u201cAm I a hunter or am I not?\u201d\n\nThey nodded, simply. He was a hunter all right. No one doubted that.\n\n\u201cWell then\u2014I\u2019ve been all over this island. By myself. If there were a beast I\u2019d have seen it. Be frightened because you\u2019re like that\u2014but there is no beast in the forest.\u201d\n\nJack handed back the conch and sat down. The whole assembly applauded him with relief. Then Piggy held out his hand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with all Jack said, but with some. \u2019Course there isn\u2019t a beast in the forest. How could there be? What would a beast eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cPig.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe eat pig.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiggy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the conch!\u201d said Piggy indignantly. \u201cRalph\u2014they ought to shut up, oughtn\u2019t they? You shut up, you littluns! What I mean is that I don\u2019t agree about this here fear. Of course there isn\u2019t nothing to be afraid of in the forest. Why\u2014I been there myself! You\u2019ll be talking about ghosts and such things next. We know what goes on and if there\u2019s something wrong, there\u2019s someone to put it right.\u201d\n\nHe took off his glasses and blinked at them. The sun had gone as if the light had been turned off.\n\nHe proceeded to explain.\n\n\u201cIf you get a pain in your stomach, whether it\u2019s a little one or a big one\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYours is a big one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you done laughing perhaps we can get on with the meeting. And if them littluns climb back on the twister again they\u2019ll only fall off in a sec. So they might as well sit on the ground and listen. No. You have doctors for everything, even the inside of your mind. You don\u2019t really mean that we got to be frightened all the time of nothing? Life,\u201d said Piggy expansively, \u201cis scientific, that\u2019s what it is. In a year or two when the war\u2019s over they\u2019ll be travelling to Mars and back. I know there isn\u2019t\nno beast\u2014not with claws and all that, I mean\u2014but I know there isn\u2019t no fear, either.\u201d\n\nPiggy paused.\n\n\u201cUnless\u2014\u201d\n\nRalph moved restlessly.\n\n\u201cUnless what?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless we get frightened of people.\u201d\n\nA sound, half-laugh, half-jeer, rose among the seated boys.\n\nPiggy ducked his head and went on hastily.\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s hear from that littlun who talked about a beast and perhaps we can show him how silly he is.\u201d\n\nThe littluns began to jabber among themselves, then one stood forward.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cPhil.\u201d\n\nFor a littlun he was self-confident, holding out his hands, cradling the conch as Ralph did, looking round at them to collect their attention before he spoke.\n\n\u201cLast night I had a dream, a horrid dream, fighting with things. I was outside the shelter by myself, fighting with things, those twisty things in the trees.\u201d\n\nHe paused, and the other littluns laughed in horrified sympathy.\n\n\u201cThen I was frightened and I woke up. And I was outside the shelter by myself in the dark and the twisty things had gone away"\n\nThe vivid horror of this, so possible and so nakedly terrifying, held them all silent. The child\u2019s voice went piping on from behind the white conch.\n\n\u201cAnd I was frightened and started to call out for Ralph and then I saw something moving among the trees, something big and horrid.\u201d\n\nHe paused, half-frightened by the recollection yet proud of the sensation he was creating.\n\n\u201cThat was a nightmare,\u201d said Ralph. \u201cHe was walking in his sleep.\u201d\n\nThe assembly murmured in subdued agreement.\n\nThe littlun shook his head stubbornly.\n\n\u201cI was asleep when the twisty things were fighting and when they went away I was awake, and I saw something big and horrid moving in the trees.\u201d\n\nRalph held out his hands for the conch and the littlun sat down.\n\n\u201cYou were asleep. There wasn\u2019t anyone there. How could anyone be wandering about in the forest at night? Was anyone? Did anyone go out?\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause while the assembly grinned at the thought of anyone going out in the darkness. Then Simon stood up and Ralph looked at him in astonishment.\n\n\u201cYou! What were you mucking about in the dark for?\u201d\n\nSimon grabbed the conch convulsively.\n\n\u201cI wanted\u2014to go to a place\u2014a place I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat place?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a place I know. A place in the jungle.\u201d He hesitated.\n\nJack settled the question for them with that contempt in his voice that could sound so funny and so final.\n\n\u201cHe was taken short.\u201d\n\nWith a feeling of humiliation on Simon\u2019s behalf, Ralph took back the conch, looking Simon sternly in the face as he did so.\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do it again. Understand? Not at night. There\u2019s enough silly talk about beasts, without the littluns seeing you gliding about like a\u2014\u201d\n\nThe derisive laughter that rose had fear in it and condemnation.\nSimon opened his mouth to speak but Ralph had the conch, so he backed to his seat.\n\nWhen the assembly was silent Ralph turned to Piggy.\n\n\u201cWell, Piggy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was another one. Him.\u201d\n\nThe littluns pushed Percival forward, then left him by himself. He stood knee-deep in the central grass, looking at his hidden feet, trying to pretend he was in a tent. Ralph remembered another small boy who had stood like this and he flinched away from the memory. He had pushed the thought down and out of sight, where only some positive reminder like this could bring it to the surface. There had been no further numberings of the littluns, partly because there was no means of insuring that all of them were accounted for and partly because Ralph knew the answer to at least one question Piggy had asked on the mountaintop. There were little boys, fair, dark, freckled, and all dirty, but their faces were all dreadfully free of major blemishes. No one had seen the mulberry-colored birthmark again. But that time Piggy had coaxed and bullied. Tacitly admitting that he remembered the unmentionable, Ralph nodded to Piggy.\n\u201cGo on. Ask him.\u201d\n\nPiggy knelt, holding the conch.\n\n\u201cNow then. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nThe small boy twisted away into his tent. Piggy turned helplessly to Ralph, who spoke sharply.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nTormented by the silence and the refusal the assembly broke into a chant.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d\n\nRalph peered at the child in the twilight.\n\n\u201cNow tell us. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cPercival Wemys Madison. The Vicarage, Harcourt St. Anthony, Hants, telephone, telephone, tele\u2014\u201d\n\nAs if this information was rooted far down in the springs of sorrow, the littlun wept. His face puckered, the tears leapt from his eyes, his mouth opened till they could see a square black hole. At first he was a silent effigy of sorrow; but then the lamentation rose out of him, loud and sustained as the conch.\n\n\u201cShut up, you! Shut up!\u201d\n\nPercival Wemys Madison would not shut up. A spring had been tapped, far beyond the reach of authority or even physical intimidation. The crying went on, breath after breath, and seemed to sustain him upright as if he were nailed to it.\n\n\u201cShut up! Shut up!\u201d\n\nFor now the littluns were no longer silent. They were reminded of their personal sorrows; and perhaps felt themselves to share in a sorrow that was universal. They began to cry in sympathy, two of them almost as loud as Percival.\n\nMaurice saved them. He cried out.\n\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d\n\nHe pretended to fall over. He rubbed his rump and sat on the twister so that he fell in the grass. He downed badly; but Percival and the others noticed and sniffed and laughed. Presently they were all laughing so absurdly that the biguns joined in.\n\nJack was the first to make himself heard. He had not got the conch and thus spoke against the rules; but nobody minded.\n\n\u201cAnd what about the beast?\u201d\n\nSomething strange was happening to Percival. He yawned and staggered, so that Jack seized and shook him.\n\n\u201cWhere does the beast live?\u201d\n\nPercival sagged in Jack\u2019s grip.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a clever beast,\u201d said Piggy, jeering, \u201cif it can hide on this island.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack\u2019s been everywhere\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere could a beast live?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeast my foot!\u201d\n\nPercival muttered something and the assembly laughed again. Ralph leaned forward.\n\n\u201cWhat does he say?\u201d\n\nJack listened to Percival\u2019s answer and then let go of him. Percival, released, surrounded by the comfortable presence of humans, fell in the long grass and went to sleep.\n\nJack cleared his throat, then reported casually.\n\n\u201cHe says the beast comes out of the sea.\u201d\n\nThe last laugh died away. Ralph turned involuntarily, a black, humped figure against the lagoon. The assembly looked with him, considered the vast stretches of water, the high sea beyond, unknown indigo of infinite possibility, heard silently the sough and whisper from the reef.\n\nMaurice spoke, so loudly that they jumped.\n\n\u201cDaddy said they haven\u2019t found all the animals in the sea yet."\n\nArgument started again. Ralph held out the glimmering conch and Maurice took it obediently. The meeting subsided.\n\n\u201cI mean when Jack says you can be frightened because people are frightened anyway that\u2019s all right. But when he says there\u2019s only pigs on this island I expect he\u2019s right but he doesn\u2019t know, not really, not certainly I mean\u2014\u201d Maurice took a breath. \u201cMy daddy says there\u2019s things, what d\u2019you call\u2019em that make ink\u2014squids\u2014that are hundreds of yards long and eat whales whole.\u201d He paused again and laughed gaily. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the beast of course. As Piggy says, life\u2019s scientific, but we don\u2019t\nknow, do we? Not certainly, I mean\u2014\u201d\n\nSomeone shouted.\n\n\u201cA squid couldn\u2019t come up out of the water!\u201d\n\n\u201cCould!\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nIn a moment the platform was full of arguing, gesticulating shadows. To Ralph, seated, this seemed the breaking up of sanity. Fear, beasts, no general agreement that the fire was all-important: and when one tried to get the thing straight the argument sheered off, bringing up fresh, unpleasant matter.\n\nHe could see a whiteness in the gloom near him so he grabbed it from Maurice and blew as loudly as he could. The assembly was shocked into silence. Simon was close to him, laying hands on the conch. Simon felt a perilous necessity to speak; but to speak in assembly was a terrible thing to him.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said hesitantly, \u201cmaybe there is a beast.\u201d\n\nThe assembly cried out savagely and Ralph stood up in amazement.\n\n\u201cYou, Simon? You believe in this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Simon. His heartbeats were choking him. \u201cBut. . . \u201d\n\nThe storm broke.\n\n\u201cSit down!\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the conch!\u201d\n\n\u201cSod you!\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\n\nRalph shouted.\n\n\u201cHear him! He\u2019s got the conch!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I mean is. . . maybe it\u2019s only us.\u201d\n\n\u201cNuts!\u201d\n\nThat was from Piggy, shocked out of decorum. Simon went on.\n\n\u201cWe could be sort of. . . \u201d\n\nSimon became inarticulate in his effort to express mankind\u2019s essential illness. Inspiration came to him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the dirtiest thing there is?\u201d\n\nAs an answer Jack dropped into the uncomprehending silence that followed it the one crude expressive syllable. Release was immense. Those littluns who had climbed back on the twister fell off again and did not mind. The hunters were screaming with delight.\n\nSimon\u2019s effort fell about him in ruins; the laughter beat him cruelly and he shrank away defenceless to his seat.\n\nAt last the assembly was silent again. Someone spoke out of turn.\n\n\u201cMaybe he means it\u2019s some sort of ghost.\u201d\n\nRalph lifted the conch and peered into the gloom. The lightest thing was the pale beach. Surely the littluns were nearer? Yes\u2014there was no doubt about it, they were huddled into a tight knot of bodies in the central grass. A flurry of wind made the palms talk and the noise seemed very loud now that darkness and silence made it so noticeable. Two grey trunks rubbed each other with an evil speaking that no one had noticed by day.\n\nPiggy took the conch out of his hands. His voice was indignant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in no ghosts\u2014ever!\u201d\n\nJack was up too, unaccountably angry.\n\n\u201cWho cares what you believe\u2014Fatty!\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the conch!\u201d\n\nThere was the sound of a brief tussle and the conch moved to and fro.\n\n\u201cYou gimme the conch back!\u201d\n\nRalph pushed between them and got a thump on the chest. He wrestled the conch from someone and sat down breathlessly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much talk about ghosts. We ought to have left all this for daylight.\u201d\n\nA hushed and anonymous voice broke in.\n\n\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s what the beast is\u2014a ghost.\u201d\n\nThe assembly was shaken as by a wind.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much talking out of turn,\u201d Ralph said, \u201cbecause we can\u2019t have proper assemblies if you don\u2019t stick to the rules.\u201d\n\nHe stopped again. The careful plan of this assembly had broken down.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want me to say then? I was wrong to call this assembly so late. We\u2019ll have a vote on them; on ghosts I mean; and then go to the shelters because we\u2019re all tired. No\u2014Jack is it?\u2014wait a minute. I\u2019ll say here and now that I don\u2019t believe in ghosts. Or I don\u2019t think I do. But I don\u2019t like the thought of them. Not now that is, in the dark. But we were going to decide what\u2019s what.\u201d\n\nHe raised the conch for a moment.\n\n\u201cVery well then. I suppose what\u2019s what is whether there are ghosts or not\u2014\u201d\n\nHe thought for a moment, formulating the question.\n\n\u201cWho thinks there may be ghosts?\u201d\n\nFor a long time there was silence and no apparent movement. Then Ralph peered into the gloom and made out the hands. He spoke flatly.\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\nThe world, that understandable and lawful world, was slipping away. Once there was this and that; and now\u2014 and the ship had gone.\n\nThe conch was snatched from his hands and Piggy\u2019s voice shrilled.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t vote for no ghosts!\u201d\n\nHe whirled round on the assembly\n\n\u201cRemember that, all of you!\u201d\n\nThey heard him stamp.\n\n\u201cWhat are we? Humans? Or animals? Or savages? What\u2019s grown-ups going to think? Going off\u2014hunting pigs\u2014letting fires out\u2014and now!\u201d\n\nA shadow fronted him tempestuously.\n\n\u201cYou shut up, you fat slug!\u201d\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s struggle and the glimmering conch jigged up and down. Ralph leapt to his feet.\n\n\u201cJack! Jack! You haven\u2019t got the conch! Let him speak.\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s face swam near him.\n\n\u201cAnd you shut up! Who are you, anyway? Sitting there telling people what to do. You can\u2019t hunt, you can\u2019t sing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m chief. I was chosen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should choosing make any difference? Just giving orders that don\u2019t make any sense\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPiggy\u2019s got the conch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2014favor Piggy as you always do\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJack!\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s voice sounded in bitter mimicry.\n\n\u201cJack! Jack!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rules!\u201d shouted Ralph. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the rules!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d\n\nRalph summoned his wits.\n\n\u201cBecause the rules are the only thing we\u2019ve got!\u201d\n\nBut Jack was shouting against him.\n\n\u201cBollocks to the rules! We\u2019re strong\u2014we hunt! If there\u2019s a beast, we\u2019ll hunt it down! We\u2019ll close in and beat and beat and beat\u2014!\u201d\n\nHe gave a wild whoop and leapt down to the pale sand. At once\nthe platform was full of noise and excitement, scramblings, screams and laughter. The assembly shredded away and became a discursive and random scatter from the palms to the water and away along the beach, beyond night-sight. Ralph found his cheek touching the conch and took it from Piggy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s grown-ups going to say?\u201d cried Piggy again. \u201cLook at \u2019em!\u201d\n\nThe sound of mock hunting, hysterical laughter and real terror came from the beach.\n\n\u201cBlow the conch, Ralph.\u201d\n\nPiggy was so close that Ralph could see the glint of his one glass.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the fire. Can\u2019t they see?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got to be tough now. Make \u2019em do what you want.\u201d\n\nRalph answered in the cautious voice of one who rehearses a theorem.\n\n\u201cIf I blow the conch and they don\u2019t come back; then we\u2019ve had it. We shan\u2019t keep the fire going. We\u2019ll be like animals. We\u2019ll never be rescued.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t blow, we\u2019ll soon be animals anyway. I can\u2019t see what they\u2019re doing but I can hear.\u201d\n\nThe dispersed figures had come together on the sand and were a dense black mass that revolved. They were chanting something and littluns that had had enough were staggering away, howling. Ralph raised the conch to his lips and then lowered it.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is: Are there ghosts, Piggy? Or beasts?\u201d\n\n\u201cCourse there aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Cos things wouldn\u2019t make sense. Houses an\u2019 streets, an\u2019\u2014TV\u2014they wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe dancing, chanting boys had worked themselves away till their sound was nothing but a wordless rhythm.\n\n\u201cBut s\u2019pose they don\u2019t make sense? Not here, on this island? Supposing things are watching us and waiting?\u201d\n\nRalph shuddered violently and moved closer to Piggy, so that they bumped frighteningly.\n\n\u201cYou stop talking like that! We got enough trouble, Ralph, an\u2019 I\u2019ve had as much as I can stand. If there is ghosts\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI ought to give up being chief. Hear \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh lord! Oh no!\u201d\n\nPiggy gripped Ralph\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cIf Jack was chief he\u2019d have all hunting and no fire. We\u2019d be here till we died.\u201d\n\nHis voice ran up to a squeak.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that sitting there?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe. Simon.\u201d\n\n\u201cFat lot of good we are,\u201d said Ralph. \u201cThree blind mice. I\u2019ll give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you give up,\u201d said Piggy, in an appalled whisper, \u201cwhat \u2019ud happen to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hates me. I dunno why. If he could do what he wanted\u2014you\u2019re all right, he respects you. Besides\u2014you\u2019d hit him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were having a nice fight with him just now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had the conch,\u201d said Piggy simply. \u201cI had a right to speak.\u201d\n\nSimon stirred in the dark.\n\n\u201dGo on being chief.\u201c\n\n\u201dYou shut up, young Simon! Why couldn\u2019t you say there wasn\u2019t a beast?"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared of him,\u201d said Piggy, \u201cand that\u2019s why I know him. If you\u2019re scared of someone you hate him but you can\u2019t stop thinking about him. You kid yourself he\u2019s all right really, an\u2019 then when you see him again; it\u2019s like asthma an\u2019 you can\u2019t breathe. I tell you what. He hates you too, Ralph\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? Why me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno. You got him over the fire; an\u2019 you\u2019re chief an\u2019 he isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s, he\u2019s, Jack Merridew!\u201d\n\n\u201cI been in bed so much I done some thinking. I know about people. I know about me. And him. He can\u2019t hurt you: but if you stand out of the way he\u2019d hurt the next thing. And that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiggy\u2019s right, Ralph. There\u2019s you and Jack. Go on being chief.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all drifting and things are going rotten. At home there was always a grown-up. Please, sir, please, miss; and then you got an answer. How I wish!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish my auntie was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish my father. . . Oh, what\u2019s the use?"\n\n\u201cKeep the fire going.\u201d\n\nThe dance was over and the hunters were going back to the shelters.\n\n\u201cGrown-ups know things,\u201d said Piggy. \u201cThey ain\u2019t afraid of the dark. They\u2019d meet and have tea and discuss. Then things \u2019ud be all right\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t set fire to the island. Or lose\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d build a ship\u2014\u201d\n\nThe three boys stood in the darkness, striving unsuccessfully to convey the majesty of adult life.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t quarrel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr break my specs\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr talk about a beast\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf only they could get a message to us,\u201d cried Ralph desperately. \u201cIf only they could send us something grown-up.. . . a sign or something.\u201d\n\nA thin wail out of the darkness chilled them and set them grabbing for each other. Then the wail rose, remote and unearthly, and turned to an inarticulate gibbering. Percival Wemys Madison, of the Vicarage, Harcourt St. Anthony, lying in the long grass, was living through circumstances in which the incantation of his address was powerless to help him.',ue='There was no light left except the stars. When they had understood what made this ghostly noise and Percival was quiet again, Ralph and Simon picked him up unhandily and carried him to a shelter. Piggy hung about near for all his brave words, and the three bigger boys went together to the next shelter. They lay (without much sleep/without being tired) and noisily among the dry leaves, watching the patch of stars that was the opening toward the lagoon. Sometimes a littlun cried out from the other shelters and once a bigun spoke in the dark. Then they too fell asleep.\nA sliver of moon rose over the (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), hardly large enough to make a path of light even when it sat right down on the water; but there were other lights in the sky, that moved fast, winked, or went out, though not even a faint popping came down from the fight fought at ten miles\' height. But a sign came down from the world of grownups, though at the time there was no child awake to read it. There was a sudden bright explosion and corkscrew trail across the sky; then darkness again and stars. There was a speck above the island, a figure dropping quickly beneath a parachute, a figure that hung with hanging (by a thread) limbs. The changing winds of different heights took the figure where they would. Then, three miles up, the wind steadied and bore it in a lowering/downward-moving/originating curve round the sky and swept it in a great slant across the reef and the lagoon toward the mountain. The figure fell and crumpled among the blue flowers of the mountain-side, but now there was a gentle breeze at this height too and the parachute flopped and banged and pulled. So the figure, with feet that dragged behind it, slid up the mountain. Yard by yard, puff by puff, the breeze dragged/carried the figure through the blue flowers, over the giant rocks and red stones, till it lay huddled among the shattered rocks of the mountain-top. Here the breeze was (on-and-off/with stops and starts) and allowed the strings of the parachute to tangle and decorate; and the figure sat, its helmeted head between its knees, held by a difficulty of lines. When the breeze blew, the lines would strain tightly stretched and some (sudden unplanned bad event/crash) of this pull lifted the head and chest upright so that the figure seemed to look carefully across (to better see something that\'s unclear) the brow of the mountain. Then, each time the wind dropped, the lines would slow/loosen and the figure bow forward again, sinking its head between its knees. So as the stars moved across the sky, the figure sat on the mountain-top and bowed and sank and bowed again.\nIn the darkness of early morning there were noises by a rock a little way down the side of the mountain. Two boys rolled out a pile of brushwood and dead leaves, two dim shadows talking sleepily to each other. They were the twins, on duty at the fire. In your mind (but maybe not in real life) one should have been asleep and one on watch. But they could never manage to do things (in a way that is reasonable and shows good judgment) if that meant acting independently, and since staying awake all night was impossible, they had both gone to sleep. Now they approached the darker smudge that had been the signal fire, yawning, rubbing their eyes, treading with practiced feet. When they reached it they stopped yawning, and one ran quickly back for brushwood and leaves.\nThe other kneeled down.\n"I believe it\'s out."\nHe fiddled with the sticks that were pushed into his hands.\n"No."\nHe lay down and put his lips close to the smudge and blew soffly. His face appeared, lit redly. He stopped blowing for a moment.\n"Sam--give us--"\n"--(things used to start a fire, like twigs, etc.) wood."\nEric bent down and blew softly again till the patch was bright. Sam poked the piece of (things used to start a fire, like twigs, etc.) wood into the hot spot, then a branch. The glow increased and the branch took fire. Sam piled on more branches.\n"Don\'t burn the lot," said Eric, "you\'re putting on too much."\n"Let\'s warm up."\n"We\'ll only have to fetch more wood."\n"I\'m cold."\n"So\'m I."\n"Besides, it\'s--"\n"--dark. All right, then."\nEric squatted back and watched Sam make up the fire. He built a little tent of dead wood and the fire was safely get on/on fire.\n"That was near."\n"He\'d have been--"\n"Waxy."\n"Huh."\nFor a few moments the twins watched the fire in silence. Then Eric giggled.\n"Wasn\'t he waxy?"\n"About the--"\n"Fire and the pig."\n"Lucky he went for Jack, \'stead of us."\n"Huh. Remember old Waxy at school?"\n"\'Boy--you-are-driving-me-slowly-insane!\'"\nThe twins shared their identical laughter, then remembered the darkness and other things and quickly looked round uneasily. The flames, busy about the tent, drew their eyes back again. Eric watched the quickly running woodlice that were so (in a rushed and upset way) unable to avoid the flames, and thought of the first fire--just down there, on the steeper side of the mountain, where now was complete darkness. He did not like to remember it, and looked away at the mountain-top.\nWarmth radiated now, and beat pleasantly on them. Sam made happy himself by fitting branches into the fire as closely as possible. Eric spread out his hands, searching for the distance at which the heat was just (bad, but not too bad). In a lazy way looking beyond the fire, he resettled the scattered rocks from their flat shadows into daylight outlines. Just there was the big rock, and the three stones there, that split rock, and there beyond was a gap--just there--\n"Sam."\n"Huh?"\n"Nothing."\nThe flames were mastering the branches, the bark was curling and falling away, the wood exploding. The tent fell inwards and threw/thrown a wide circle of light over the mountain-top.\n"Sam--"\n"Huh?"\n"Sam! Sam!"\nSam looked at Eric irritably. The strength of Eric\'s look made the direction in which he looked terrible, for Sam had his back to it. He moved (quickly)/mixed up round the fire, squatted by Eric, and looked to see. They became totally still, gripped in each other\'s arms, four unwinking eyes aimed and two mouths open.\nFar beneath them, the trees of the forest sighed, then roared. The hair on their foreheads flapped wings/moved unsteadily and flames blew out sideways from the fire. Fifteen yards away from them came the plopping noise of fabric blown open.\nNeither of the boys screamed but the grip of their arms tightened and their mouths grew peaked. For maybe ten seconds they bent down like that while the waving (one\'s) arms fire sent smoke and sparks and waves of unsteady/unreliable light over the top of the mountain.\nThen like they had only one scared (very much) mind between them they moved (quickly)/mixed up away over the rocks and ran away/escaped.\n\nRalph was dreaming. He had fallen asleep after what seemed hours of tossing and turning noisily among the dry leaves. Even the sounds of nightmare from the other shelters no longer reached him, for he was back to where he came from, feeding the ponies with sugar over the garden wall. Then someone was shaking his arm, telling him that it was time for tea.\n"Ralph! Wake up!"\nThe leaves were roaring like the sea.\n"Ralph, wake up!"\n"What\'s the matter?"\n"We saw--"\n"--the beast--"\n"--plain!"\n"Who are you? The twins?"\n"We saw the beast--"\n"Quiet. Piggy!"\nThe leaves were roaring still. Piggy bumped into him and a twin grabbed him as he made for the wider-than-tall of paling stars.\n"You can\'t go out--it\'s (very bad and upsetting)!"\n"Piggy--where are the spears?"\n"I can hear the--"\n"Quiet then. Lie still."\nThey lay there listening, at first with doubt but then with terror to the description the twins breathed at them between episodes of extreme silence. Soon the darkness was full of claws, full of the awful unknown and menace. A never-ending dawn faded the stars out, and at last light, sad and grey, filtered into the shelter. They began to stir though still the world outside the shelter was impossibly dangerous. The maze of the darkness sorted into near and far, and at the high point of the sky the cloudlets were warmed with color. A single sea bird flapped upwards with a rough-sounding cry that was echoed now, and something squawked in the forest. Now streaks of cloud near the (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet) began to glow rosily, and the feathery tops of the palms were green.\nRalph kneeled in the entrance to the shelter and stared carefully round him.\n"Sam \'n Eric. Call them to a (group of people/device made up of smaller parts). Quietly. Go on."\nThe twins, holding unsteadily to each other, dared the few yards to the next shelter and spread the terrible news. Ralph stood up and walked for the benefit of self-respect/built-in worth, though with his back pricking, to the (raised, flat supporting surface). Piggy and Simon followed him and the other boys came sneaking after.\nRalph took the conch from where it lay on the polished seat and held it to his lips; but then he waited and did not blow. He held the shell up instead and showed it to them and they understood.\nThe rays of the sun that were fanning upwards from below the (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet) swung downwards to eye-level. Ralph looked for a moment at the growing slice of gold that lit them from the right hand and seemed to make speech possible. The circle of boys before him got angry with hunting spears.\nHe handed the conch to Eric, the nearest of the twins.\n"We\'ve seen the beast with our own eyes. No--we weren\'t asleep--"\nSam took up the story. By custom now one conch did for both twins, for their big togetherness was recognized.\n"It was furry. There was something moving behind its head--wings. The beast moved too--"\n"That was awful. It kind of sat up--"\n"The fire was bright--"\n"We\'d just made it up--"\n"--more sticks on--"\n"There were eyes--"\n"Teeth--"\n"Claws--"\n"We ran as fast as we could--"\n"Smashed (with something heavy) into things--"\n"The beast followed us--"\n"I saw it moving behind the trees--"\n"Nearly touched me--"\nRalph pointed terribly/scared at Eric\'s face, which was striped with scars where the bushes had torn him.\n"How did you do that?"\nEric felt his face.\n"I\'m all rough. Am I bleeding?"\nThe circle of boys shrank away in horror. Johnny, yawning still, burst into noisy tears and was slapped by Bill till he choked on them. The bright morning was full of threats and the circle began to change. It faced out, rather than in, and the spears of sharpened wood were like a fence. Jack called them back to the center.\n"This\'ll be a real hunt! Who\'ll come?"\nRalph moved impatiently.\n"These spears are made of wood. Don\'t be silly."\nJack frowned at him.\n"Frightened?"\n"\'Course I\'m frightened. Who wouldn\'t be?"\nHe turned to the twins, wishing but hopeless.\n"I suppose you aren\'t pulling our legs?"\nThe reply was too loud and clear for anyone to doubt them.\nPiggy took the conch.\n"Couldn\'t we--kind of--stay here? Maybe the beast won\'t come near us."\nBut for the sense of something watching them, Ralph would have shouted at him.\n"Stay here? And be cramped into this bit of the island, always on the lookout? How should we get our food? And what about the fire?"\n"Let\'s be moving," said Jack unstoppably, "we\'re wasting time."\n"No we\'re not. What about the littluns?"\n"Sucks to the littluns!"\n"Someone\'s got to look after them."\n"Nobody has so far."\n"There was no need! Now there is. Piggy\'ll look after them."\n"That\'s right. Keep Piggy out of danger."\n"Have some sense. What can Piggy do with only one eye?"\nThe rest of the boys were looking from Jack to Ralph, curiously.\n"And another thing. You can\'t have an ordinary hunt because the beast doesn\'t leave tracks. If it did you\'d have seen them. For all we know, the beast may swing through the trees like what\'s its name."\nThey nodded.\n"So we\'ve got to think."\nPiggy took off his damaged (lenses worn on the face that improve vision) and cleaned the remaining lens.\n"How about us, Ralph?"\n"You haven\'t got the conch. Here."\n"I mean--how about us? Suppose the beast comes when you\'re all away. I can\'t see proper, and if I get scared--"\nJack broke in, hatefully.\n"You\'re always scared."\n"I got the conch--"\n"Conch! Conch!" shouted Jack. "We don\'t need the conch any more. We know who should say things. What good did Simon do speaking, or Bill, or Walter? It\'s time some people knew they\'ve got to keep quiet and leave deciding things to the rest of us."\nRalph could no longer ignore his speech. The blood was hot in his cheeks.\n"You haven\'t got the conch," he said. "Sit down."\nJack\'s face went so white that the freckles showed as clear, brown flecks. He licked his lips and remained standing.\n"This is a hunter\'s job."\nThe rest of the boys watched intently. Piggy, finding himself uncomfortably embroiled, slid the conch to Ralph\'s knees and sat down. The silence grew terrible (because of mistreatment) and Piggy held his breath.\n"This is more than a hunter\'s job," said Ralph at last, "because you can\'t track the beast. And don\'t you want to be rescued?"\nHe turned to the (group of people/device made up of smaller parts).\n"Don\'t you all want to be rescued?"\nHe looked back at Jack.\n"I said before, the fire is the main thing. Now the fire must be out--"\nThe old extreme irritation saved him and gave him the energy to attack.\n"Hasn\'t anyone got any sense? We\'ve got to relight that fire. You never thought of that, Jack, did you? Or don\'t any of you want to be rescued?"\nYes, they wanted to be rescued, there was no doubt about that; and with a violent swing to Ralph\'s side, the serious problem passed. Piggy let out his breath with a (sudden, short breath in), reached for it again and failed. He lay against a log, his mouth staring, blue shadows creeping round his lips. Nobody minded him.\n"Now think, Jack. Is there anywhere on the island you haven\'t been?"\nUnwillingly Jack answered.\n"There\'s only--but of course! You remember? The tail-end part, where the rocks are all piled up. I\'ve been near there. The rock makes a sort of bridge. There\'s only one way up."\n"And the thing might live there."\nAll the (group of people/device made up of smaller parts) talked at once.\n"Quite! All right. That\'s where we\'ll look. If the beast isn\'t there we\'ll go up the mountain and look; and light the fire."\n"Let\'s go."\n"We\'ll eat first. Then go." Ralph paused. "We\'d better take spears."\nAfter they had eaten, Ralph and the biguns set out along the beach. They left Piggy propped up on the (raised, flat supporting surface). This day promised, like the others, to be a sunbath under a blue dome. The beach stretched away before them in a gentle curve till (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) drew it into one with the forest; for the day was not advanced enough to be hid/hidden by the shifting covers of mirage. Under Ralph\'s direction, they picked up a careful way along the palm terrace, rather than dare the hot sand down by the water. He let Jack lead the way; and Jack walked with dramatic/theater-based caution though they could have seen an enemy twenty yards away. Ralph walked in the rear, thankful to have escaped responsibility for a time.\nSimon, walking in front of Ralph, felt a flicker of state of shock--a beast with claws that scratched, that sat on a mountain-top, that left no tracks and yet was not fast enough to catch Samneric. However Simon thought of the beast, there rose before his inward sight the picture of a human at once heroic and sick.\nHe sighed. Other people could stand up and speak to a (group of people/device made up of smaller parts), (based on what\'s seen or what seems obvious), without that terrible feeling of the pressure of personality; could say what they would like they were speaking to only one person. He stepped aside and looked back. Ralph was coming along, holding his spear over his shoulder. Shyly, Simon allowed his pace to slow/loosen until he was walking side by side with Ralph and looking up at him through the rough black hair that now fell to his eyes. Ralph quickly looked sideways, smiled held backly like he had forgotten that Simon had made a fool of himself, then looked away again at nothing. For a moment or two Simon was happy to be accepted and then he stopped to think about himself. When he smashed (with something heavy) into a tree Ralph looked sideways impatiently and Robert giggled. Simon reeled and a white spot on his forehead turned red and trickled. Ralph dismissed Simon and returned to his personal hell. They would reach the (huge, fancy, stone house) some time; and the chief would have to go forward.\nJack came running back. "We\'re in sight now."\n"All right. We\'ll get as close as we can."\nHe followed Jack toward the (huge, fancy, stone house) where the ground rose (a) little. On their left was an (unable to be understood or broken through) tangle of creepers and trees.\n"Why couldn\'t there be something in that?"\n"Because you can see. Nothing goes in or out."\n"What about the (huge, fancy, stone house) then?"\n"Look."\nRalph parted the screen of grass and looked out. There were only a few more yards of stony ground and then the two sides of the island came almost together so that one expected a peak of headland. But instead of this a narrow ledge of rock, a few yards wide and maybe fifteen long, continued the island out into the sea. There lay another of those pieces of pink squareness that underlay the structure of the island. This side of the (huge, fancy, stone house), maybe a hundred feet high, was the pink strong protector they had seen from the mountain-top. The rock of the cliff was split and the top covered with many great lumps that seemed to walk unsteadily.\nBehind Ralph the tall grass had filled with silent hunters. Ralph looked at Jack.\n"You\'re a hunter."\nJack went red.\n"I know. All right."\nSomething deep in Ralph spoke for him.\n"I\'m chief. I\'ll go. Don\'t argue."\nHe turned to the others.\n"You. Hide here. Wait for me."\nHe found his voice tended either to disappear or to come out too loud. He looked at Jack.\n"Do you--think?"\nJack mumbled.\n"I\'ve been all over. It must be here."\n"I see."\nSimon talked quietly and unclearly confusedly: "I don\'t believe in the beast."\nRalph answered him politely, as if agreeing about the weather.\n"No. I suppose not."\nHis mouth was tight and pale. He put back his hair very slowly.\n"Well. So long."\nHe forced his feet to move until they had carried him out on to the neck of land.\nHe was surrounded on all sides by deep divisions of empty air. There was nowhere to hide, even if one did not have to go on. He paused on the narrow neck and looked down. Soon, in a matter of centuries, the sea would make an island of the (huge, fancy, stone house). On the right hand was the lagoon, worried by/bothered by the open sea; and on the left-- Ralph body-shook (from being upset). The lagoon had protected them from the Pacific: and for some reason only Jack had gone right down to the water on the other side. Now he saw the landsman\'s view of the swell and it seemed like the breathing of some amazing creature. Slowly the waters sank among the rocks, showing/telling about pink tables of (very hard rock), strange growths of coral, abnormal growth, and weed. Down, down, the waters went, whispering like the wind among the heads of the forest. There was one flat rock there, spread like a table, and the waters sucking down on the four weedy sides made them seem like cliffs. Then the sleeping monster breathed out, the waters rose, the weed streamed, and the water boiled over the table rock with a roar. There was no sense of the passage of waves; only this minute-long fall and rise and fall.\nRalph turned away to the red cliff. They were waiting behind him in the long grass, waiting to see what he would do. He (saw/heard/became aware of) that the sweat in his palm was cool now; (understood/made real/achieved) with surprise that he did not really expect to meet any beast and didn\'t know what he would do about it if he did.\nHe saw that he could climb the cliff but this was not necessary. The squareness of the rock allowed a sort of plinth round it, so that to the right, over the lagoon, one could inch along a ledge and turn the corner out of sight. It was easy going, and soon he was looking round the rock.\nNothing but what you might expect: pink, tumbled giant rocks with animal droppings layered on them like icing; and a steep slope up to the shattered rocks that crowned the strong protector.\nA sound behind him made him turn. Jack was edging along the ledge.\n"Couldn\'t let you do it on your own."\nRalph said nothing. He led the way over the rocks, inspected a sort of half-cave that held nothing more terrible than a tight hand-hold of rotten eggs, and at last sat down, looking round him and tapping the rock with the butt of his spear.\nJack was excited.\n"What a place for a fort!"\nA column of spray wetted them.\n"No fresh water."\n"What\'s that then?"\nThere was in fact a long green smudge half-way up the rock. They climbed up and tasted the trickle of water.\n"You could keep a coconut shell there, filling all the time."\n"Not me. This is a rotten place."\nSide by side they scaled the last height to where the reducing pile was crowned by the last broken rock. Jack struck the near one with his fist and it grated (a) little.\n"Do you remember--?"\nAwakeness/awareness of the bad times in between came to them both. Jack talked quickly.\n"Shove a palm trunk under that and if an enemy came-- look!"\nA hundred feet below them was the narrow road (raised above water, sand, etc.), then the stony ground, then the grass dotted with heads, and behind that the forest.\n"One lift up/throw (something heavy)," cried Jack, celebrating, "and--wheee--!"\nHe made a sweeping movement with his hand. Ralph looked toward the mountain.\n"What\'s the matter?"\nRalph turned.\n"Why?"\n"You were looking--I don\'t know why."\n"There\'s no signal now. Nothing to show."\n"You\'re nuts on the signal."\nThe tightly stretched blue (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet) encircled them, broken only by the mountain-top.\n"That\'s all we\'ve got."\nHe leaned his spear against the rocking stone and pushed back two handfuls of hair.\n"We\'ll have to go back and climb the mountain. That\'s where they saw the beast."\n"The beast won\'t be there."\n"What else can we do?"\nThe others, waiting in the grass, saw Jack and Ralph unharmed and broke cover into the sunlight. They forgot the beast in the excitement of exploring things. They moved in huge numbers across the bridge and soon were climbing and shouting. Ralph stood now, one hand against a huge red block, a block large as a mill wheel that had been split off and hung, unsteadily-walking. Sadly he watched the mountain. He squeezed tightly his fist and beat hammer-wise on the red wall at his right. His lips were tightly (pressed or forced into a smaller space) and his eyes wished beneath the edge of hair.\n"Smoke."\nHe sucked his injured (without bleeding) fist.\n"Jack! Come on."\nBut Jack was not there. A knot of boys, making a great noise that he had not (saw/heard/became aware of), were lifting up/throwing (something heavy) and pushing at a rock. As he turned, the base cracked and the whole mass toppled into the sea so that a very loud plume of spray jumped half-way up the cliff.\n"Stop it! Stop it!"\nHis voice struck a silence among them.\n"Smoke."\nA strange thing happened in his head. Something waved/flapped there in front of his mind like a bat\'s wing, hiding/blocking his idea.\n"Smoke."\nAt once the ideas were back, and the anger.\n"We want smoke. And you go wasting your time. You roll rocks."\nRoger shouted.\n"We\'ve got plenty of time!"\nRalph shook his head.\n"We\'ll go to the mountain."\nThe loud noise/yell broke out. Some of the boys wanted to go back to the beach. Some wanted to roll more rocks. The sun was bright and danger had faded with the darkness.\n"Jack. The beast might be on the other side. You can lead again. You\'ve been."\n"We could go by the shore. There\'s fruit."\nBill came up to Ralph.\n"Why can\'t we stay here for a bit?"\n"That\'s right.\'\'\n"Let\'s have a fort."\n"There\'s no food here," said Ralph, "and no shelter. Not much fresh water."\n"This would make a wizard fort."\n"We can roll rocks--"\n"Right onto the bridge--"\n"I say we\'ll go on!" shouted Ralph angrily/desperately. "We\'ve got to make certain. We\'ll go now."\n"Let\'s stay here--"\n"Back to the shelter--"\n"I\'m tired--"\n"No!"\nRalph struck the skin off his knuckles. They did not seem to hurt.\n"I\'m chief. We\'ve got to make certain. Can\'t you see the mountain? There\'s no signal showing. There may be a ship out there. Are you all off your rockers?"\nViolently and disobediently, the boys fell silent or mumbling.\nJack led the way down the rock and across the bridge.',ce="The pig-run kept close to the jumble of rocks that lay down by the water on the other side and Ralph was content to follow Jack along it. If you could shut your ears to the slow suck down of the sea and boil of the return, if you could forget how dun and unvisited were the ferny coverts on either side, then there was a chance that you might put the beast out of mind and dream for a while. The sun had swung over the vertical and the afternoon heat was closing in on the island. Ralph passed a message forward to Jack and when they next came to fruit the whole party stopped and ate.\n\nSitting, Ralph was aware of the heat for the first time that day. He pulled distastefully at his grey shirt and wondered whether he might un-dertake the adventure of washing it. Sitting under what seemed an un-usual heat, even for this island, Ralph planned his toilet. He would like to have a pair of scissors and cut this hair\u2014he flung the mass back\u2014cut this filthy hair right back to half an inch. He would like to have a bath, a proper wallow with soap. He passed his tongue experimentally over his teeth and decided that a toothbrush would come in handy too. Then there were his nails\u2014\n\nRalph turned his hand over and examined them. They were bitten down to the quick though he could not remember when he had restarted this habit nor any time when he indulged it.\n\n\u201cBe sucking my thumb next\u2014\u201d\n\nHe looked round, furtively. Apparently no one had heard. The hunters sat, stuffing themselves with this easy meal, trying to convince themselves that they got sufficient kick out of bananas and that other olive-grey, jelly-like fruit. With the memory of his sometime clean self as a standard, Ralph looked them over. They were dirty, not with the spectacular dirt of boys who have fallen into mud or been brought down hard on a rainy day. Not one of them was an obvious subject for a shower, and yet\u2014hair, much too long, tangled here and there, knotted round a dead leaf or a twig; faces cleaned fairly well by the process of eating and sweating but marked in the less accessible angles with a kind of shadow; clothes, worn away, stiff like his own with sweat, put on, not for decorum or comfort but out of custom; the skin of the body, scurfy with brine\u2014\n\nHe discovered with a little fall of the heart that these were the conditions he took as normal now and that he did not mind. He sighed and pushed away the stalk from which he had stripped the fruit. Already the hunters were stealing away to do their business in the woods or down by the rocks. He turned and looked out to sea.\n\nHere, on the other side of the island, the view was utterly different. The filmy enchantments of mirage could not endure the cold ocean water and the horizon was hard, clipped blue. Ralph wandered down to the rocks. Down here, almost on a level with the sea, you could follow with your eye the ceaseless, bulging passage of the deep sea waves. They were miles wide, apparently not breakers or the banked ridges of shallow water. They traveled the length of the island with an air of disregarding it and being set on other business; they were less a progress than a momentous rise and fall of the whole ocean. Now the sea would suck down, making cascades and waterfalls of retreating water, would sink past the rocks and plaster down the seaweed like shining hair: then, pausing, gather and rise with a roar, irresistibly swelling over point and outcrop, climbing the little cliff, sending at last an arm of surf up a gully to end a yard or so from him in fingers of spray.\n\nWave after wave, Ralph followed the rise and fall until something of the remoteness of the sea numbed his brain. Then gradually the almost infinite size of this water forced itself on his attention. This was the divider, the barrier. On the other side of the island, swathed at midday with mirage, defended by the shield of the quiet lagoon, one might dream of rescue; but here, faced by the brute obtuseness of the ocean, the miles of division, one was clamped down, one was helpless, one was condemned, one was\u2014\n\nSimon was speaking almost in his ear. Ralph found that he had rock painfully gripped in both hands, found his body arched, the muscles of his neck stiff, his mouth strained open.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get back to where you came from.\u201d\n\nSimon nodded as he spoke. He was kneeling on one knee, looking down from a higher rock which he held with both hands; his other leg stretched down to Ralph\u2019s level.\n\nRalph was puzzled and searched Simon\u2019s face for a clue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so big, I mean\u2014\u201d\n\n\nSimon nodded.\n\n\u201cAll the same. You\u2019ll get back all right. I think so, anyway.\u201d\n\nSome of the strain had gone from Ralph\u2019s body. He glanced at the sea and then smiled bitterly at Simon.\n\n\u201cGot a ship in your pocket?\u201d\n\nSimon grinned and shook his head.\n\n\u201cHow do you know, then?\u201d\n\nWhen Simon was still silent Ralph said curtly, \u201cYou\u2019re batty.\u201d\n\nSimon shook his head violently till the coarse black hair flew backwards and forwards across his face.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I just you\u2019ll get back all right.\u201d\n\nFor a moment nothing more was said. And then they suddenly smiled at each other. Roger called from the coverts.\n\n\u201cCome and see!\u201d\n\nThe ground was turned over near the pig-run and there were droppings that steamed. Jack bent down to them as though he loved them.\n\n\u201cRalph\u2014we need meat even if we are hunting the other thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you mean going the right way, we\u2019ll hunt.\u201d\n\nThey set off again, the hunters bunched a little by fear of the mentioned beast, while Jack quested ahead. They went more slowly than Ralph had bargained for; yet in a way he was glad to loiter, cradling his spear. Jack came up against some emergency of his craft and soon the procession stopped. Ralph leaned against a tree and at once the daydreams came swarming up. Jack was in charge of the hunt and there would be time to get to the mountain\u2014\n\nOnce, following his father from Chatham to Devonport, they had lived in a cottage on the edge of the moors. In the succession of houses that Ralph had known, this one stood out with particular clarity because after that house he had been sent away to school. Mummy had still been with them and Daddy had come home every day. Wild ponies came to the stone wall at the bottom of the garden, and it had snowed. Just behind the cottage there was a sort of shed and you could lie up there, watching the flakes swirl past. You could see the damp spot where each flake died, then you could mark the first flake that lay down without melting and watch, the whole ground turn white. You could go indoors when you were cold and look out of the window, past the bright copper kettle and the plate with the little blue men.\n\nWhen you went to bed there was a bowl of cornflakes with sugar and cream. And the books\u2014they stood on the shelf by the bed, leaning together with always two or three laid flat on top because he had not bothered to put them back properly. They were dog-eared and scratched.\n\nThere was the bright, shining one about Topsy and Mopsy that he never read because it was about two girls; there was the one about the magician which you read with a kind of tied-down terror, skipping page twenty-seven with the awful picture of the spider; there was a book about people who had dug things up, Egyptian things; there was The Boy\u2019s Book of Trains, The Boy\u2019s Book of Ships. Vividly they came before him; he could have reached up and touched them, could feel the weight and slow slide with which The Mammoth Book for Boys would come out and slither down. . . . Everything was all right; everything was good-humored and friendly.\n\nThe bushes crashed ahead of them. Boys flung themselves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepers, screaming. Ralph saw Jack nudged aside and fall. Then there was a creature bounding along the pig track toward him, with tusks gleaming and an intimidating grunt. Ralph found he was able to measure the distance coldly and take aim. With the boar only five yards away, he flung the foolish wooden stick that he carried, saw it hit the great snout and hang there for a moment. The boar\u2019s note changed to a squeal and it swerved aside into the covert. The pig-run filled with shouting boys again, Jack came running back, and poked about in the undergrowth.\n\n\u201cThrough here\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019d do us!\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough here, I said\u2014\u201d\n\nThe boar was floundering away from them. They found another pig-run parallel to the first and Jack raced away. Ralph was full of fright and apprehension and pride.\n\n\u201cI hit him! The spear stuck in\u2014\u201d\n\nNow they came, unexpectedly, to an open space by the sea. Jack cast about on the bare rock and looked anxious.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u201cI hit him,\u201d said Ralph again, \u201cand the spear stuck in a bit.\u201d\n\nHe felt the need of witnesses.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you see me?\u201d\n\nMaurice nodded.\n\n\u201cI saw you. Right bang on his snout\u2014Wheee!\u201d\n\nRalph talked on, excitedly.\n\n\u201cI hit him all right. The spear stuck in. I wounded him!\u201d\n\nHe sunned himself in their new respect and felt that hunting was good after all.\n\n\u201cI walloped him properly. That was the beast, I think!\u201d Jack came back.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the beast. That was a boar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hit him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you grab him? I tried\u2014\u201d\n\nRalph\u2019s voice ran up.\n\n\u201cBut a boar!\u201d\n\nJack flushed suddenly.\n\n\u201cYou said he\u2019d do us. What did you want to throw for? Why didn\u2019t you wait?\n\nHe held out his arm.\n\n\u201cLook.\u201d\n\nHe turned his left forearm for them all to see. On the outside was a rip; not much, but bloody.\n\n\u201cHe did that with his tusks. I couldn\u2019t get my spear down in time.\u201d\n\nAttention focused on Jack.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a wound,\u201d said Simon, \u201cand you ought to suck it. Like Berengaria.\u201d Jack sucked.\n\n\u201cI hit him,\u201d said Ralph indignantly. \u201cI hit him with my spear, I wounded him.\u201d\n\nHe tried for their attention.\n\n\u201cHe was coming along the path. I threw, like this\u2014\u201d\n\nRobert snarled at him. Ralph entered into the play and everybody laughed. Presently they were all jabbing at Robert who made mock rushes.\n\nJack shouted.\n\n\u201cMake a ring!\u201d\n\nThe circle moved in and round. Robert squealed in mock terror, then in real pain.\n\n\u201cOw! Stop it! You\u2019re hurting!\u201d\n\nThe butt end of a spear fell on his back as he blundered among them.\n\n\u201cHold him!\u201d\n\nThey got his arms and legs. Ralph, carried away by a sudden thick excitement, grabbed Eric\u2019s spear and jabbed at Robert with it.\n\n\u201cKill him! Kill him!\u201d\n\nAll at once, Robert was screaming and struggling with the strength of frenzy. Jack had him by the hair and was brandishing his knife. Behind him was Roger, fighting to get close. The chant rose ritually, as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt.\n\n\u201cKill the pig! Cut his throat! Kill the pig! Bash him in!\u201d\n\nRalph too was fighting to get near, to get a handful of that brown, vulnerable flesh. The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering.\n\nJack\u2019s arm came down; the heaving circle cheered and made pig-dying noises. Then they lay quiet, panting, listening to Robert\u2019s frightened snivels. He wiped his face with a dirty arm, and made an effort to retrieve his status.\n\n\u201cOh, my bum!\u201d\n\nHe rubbed his rump ruefully. Jack rolled over.\n\n\u201cThat was a good game.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a game,\u201d said Ralph uneasily. \u201cI got jolly badly hurt at rugger once.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ought to have a drum,\u201d said Maurice, \u201cthen we could do it properly.\u201d\n\nRalph looked at him.\n\n\u201cHow properly?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno. You want a fire, I think, and a drum, and you keep time to the drum.\n\n\u201cYou want a pig,\u201d said Roger, \u201clike a real hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr someone to pretend,\u201d said Jack. \u201cYou could get someone to dress up as a pig and then he could act\u2014you know, pretend to knock me over and all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a real pig,\u201d said Robert, still caressing his rump, \u201cbecause you\u2019ve got to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse a littlun,\u201d said Jack, and everybody laughed.\nRalph sat up.\n\n\u201cWell. We shan\u2019t find what we\u2019re looking for at this rate.\u201d\n\nOne by one they stood up, twitching rags into place.\n\nRalph looked at Jack.\n\n\u201cNow for the mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we go back to Piggy,\u201d said Maurice, \u201cbefore dark?\u201d\n\nThe twins nodded like one boy.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Let\u2019s go up there in the morning.\u201d\n\nRalph looked out and saw the sea.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start the fire again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got Piggy\u2019s specs,\u201d said Jack, \u201cso you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll find out if the mountain\u2019s clear.\u201d\n\nMaurice spoke, hesitating, not wanting to seem a funk.\n\n\u201cSupposing the beast\u2019s up there?\u201d\n\nJack brandished his spear.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll kill it.\u201d\n\nThe sun seemed a little cooler. He slashed with the spear.\n\n\u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Ralph, \u201dif we keep on by the sea this way, we\u2019ll come out below the burnt bit and then we can climb the mountain. Once more Jack led them along by the suck and heave of the blinding sea.\n\nOnce more Ralph dreamed, letting his skillful feet deal with the difficulties of the path. Yet here his feet seemed less skillful than before. For most of the way they were forced right down to the bare rock by the water and had to edge along between that and the dark luxuriance of the forest. There were little cliffs to be scaled, some to be used as paths, lengthy traverses where one used hands as well as feet. Here and there they could clamber over wave-wet rock, leaping across clear pools that the tide had left. They came to a gully that split the narrow foreshore like a defense. This seemed to have no bottom and they peered awe-stricken into the gloomy crack where water gurgled. Then the wave came back, the gully boiled before them and spray dashed up to the very creeper so that the boys were wet and shrieking. They tried the forest but it was thick and woven like a bird\u2019s nest. In the end they had to jump one by one, waiting till the water sank; and even so, some of them got a second drenching. After that the rocks seemed to be growing impassable so they sat for a time, letting their rags dry and watching the clipped outlines of the rollers that moved so slowly past the island. They found fruit in a haunt of bright little birds that hovered like insects. Then Ralph said they were going too slowly. He himself climbed a tree and parted the canopy, and saw the square head of the mountain seeming still a great way off.\n\nThen they tried to hurry along the rocks and Robert cut his knee quite badly and they had to recognize that this path must be taken slowly if they were to be safe. So they proceeded after that as if they were climbing a dangerous mountain, until the rocks became an uncompromising cliff, overhung with impossible jungle and falling sheer into the sea. Ralph looked at the sun critically.\n\n\u201cEarly evening. After tea-time, at any rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember this cliff,\u201d said Jack, crestfallen, \u201cso this must be the bit of the coast I missed.\u201d Ralph nodded.\n\n\u201cLet me think.\u201d\n\nBy now, Ralph had no self-consciousness in public thinking but would treat the day\u2019s decisions as though he were playing chess. The only trouble was that he would never be a very good chess player. He thought of the littluns and Piggy. Vividly he imagined Piggy by himself, huddled in a shelter that was silent except for the sounds of nightmare.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave the littluns alone with Piggy. Not all night.\u201d\n\nThe other boys said nothing but stood round, watching him.\n\n\u201cIf we went back we should take hours.\u201d\n\nJack cleared his throat and spoke in a queer, tight voice. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let anything happen to Piggy, must we?\u201d Ralph tapped his teeth with the dirty point of Eric\u2019s spear.\n\n\u201cIf we go across\u2014\u201d\n\nHe glanced round him.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to go across the island and tell Piggy we\u2019ll be back after dark.\u201d\n\nBill spoke, unbelieving.\n\n\u201cThrough the forest by himself? Now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t spare more than one.\u201d\n\nSimon pushed his way to Ralph\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go if you like. I don\u2019t mind, honestly.\u201d\n\nBefore Ralph had time to reply, he smiled quickly, turned and climbed into the forest.\n\nRalph looked back at Jack, seeing him, infuriatingly, for the first time.\n\n\u201cJack\u2014that time you went the whole way to the castle rock.\n\nJack glowered.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came along part of this shore\u2014below the mountain, beyond there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI found a pig-run. It went for miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the pig-run must be somewhere in there.\u201d\n\nRalph nodded. He pointed at the forest. Everybody agreed, sagely.\n\n\u201cAll right then. We\u2019ll smash a way through till we find the pig-run.\u201d\n\nHe took a step and halted.\n\n\u201cWait a minute though! Where does the pig-run go to?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mountain,\u201d said Jack, \u201cI told you.\u201d He sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go to the mountain?\u201d\n\nRalph sighed, sensing the rising antagonism, understanding that this was how Jack felt as soon as he ceased to lead.\n\n\u201cI was thinking of the light. We\u2019ll be stumbling about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were going to look for the beast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be enough light.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind going,\u201d said Jack hotly. \u201cI\u2019ll go when we get there. Won\u2019t you? Would you rather go back to the shelters and tell Piggy?\u201d\n\nNow it was Ralph\u2019s turn to flush but he spoke despairingly, out of the new understanding that Piggy had given him.\n\n\u201cWhy do you hate me?\u201d\n\nThe boys stirred uneasily, as though something indecent had been said. The silence lengthened. Ralph, still hot and hurt, turned away first.\n\n\u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nHe led the way and set himself as by right to hack at the tangles. Jack brought up the rear, displaced and brooding. The pig-track was a dark tunnel, for the sun was sliding quickly toward the edge of the world and in the forest shadows were never far to seek.\n\nThe track was broad and beaten and they ran along at a swift trot. Then the roof of leaves broke up and they halted, breathing quickly, looking at the few stars that pricked round the head of the mountain.\n\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d\n\nThe boys peered at each other doubtfully. Ralph made a decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go straight across to the platform and climb tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThey murmured agreement; but Jack was standing by his shoulder.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re frightened of course\u2014\u201d\n\nRalph turned on him.\n\n\u201cWho went first on the castle rock?\u201d\n\n\u201cI went too. And that was daylight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. Who wants to climb the mountain now?\u201d Silence was the only answer.\n\n\u201cSamneric? What about you?\u201d\n\n\u201dWe ought to go an\u2019 tell Piggy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014yes, tell Piggy that\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cBut Simon went!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ought to tell Piggy\u2014in case\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRobert? Bill?\u201d\n\nThey were going straight back to the platform now. Not, of course, that they were afraid\u2014but tired. Ralph turned back to Jack.\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going up the mountain.\u201d The words came from Jack viciously, as though they were a curse. He looked at Ralph, his thin body tensed, his spear held as if he threatened him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going up the mountain to look for the beast\u2014now.\u201d\n\nThen the supreme sting, the casual, bitter word.\n\n\u201dComing?\u201d\n\nAt that word the other boys forgot their urge to be gone and turned back to sample this fresh rub of two spirits in the dark. The word was too good, too bitter, too successfully daunting to be repeated. It took Ralph at low water when his nerve was relaxed for the return to the shelter and the still, friendly waters of the lagoon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nAstonished, he heard his voice come out, cool and casual, so that the bitterness of Jack\u2019s taunt fell powerless.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, not at all.\u201d\n\nJack took a step.\n\n\u201cWell then\u2014\u201d\n\nSide by side, watched by silent boys, the two started up the mountain.\n\nRalph stopped.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re silly. Why should only two go? If we find anything, two won\u2019t be enough.\u201d\n\nThere came the sound of boys scuttling away. Astonishingly, a dark figure moved against the tide.\n\n\u201cRoger?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s three, then.\u201d\n\nOnce more they set out to climb the slope of the mountain. The darkness seemed to flow round them like a tide. Jack, who had said nothing, began to choke and cough, and a gust of wind set all three spluttering.\n\nRalph\u2019s eyes were blinded with tears.\n\n\u201cAshes. We\u2019re on the edge of the burnt patch.\u201d\n\nTheir footsteps and the occasional breeze were stirring up small devils of dust. Now that they stopped again, Ralph had time while he coughed to remember how silly they were. If there was no beast\u2014and almost certainly there was no beast\u2014in that case, well and good; but if there was something waiting on top of the mountain\u2014 what was the use of three of them, handicapped by the darkness and carrying only sticks?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being fools.\u201d\n\nOut of the darkness came the answer.\n\n\u201cWindy?\u201d\n\nIrritably Ralph shook himself. This was all Jack\u2019s fault.\n\n\u201c \u2018Course I am. But we\u2019re still being fools.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go on,\u201d said the voice sarcastically, \u201cI\u2019ll go up by myself.\u201d\n\nRalph heard the mockery and hated Jack. The sting of ashes in his eyes, tiredness, fear, enraged him.\n\n\u201cGo on then! We\u2019ll wait here.\u201d\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go? Are you frightened?\u201d A stain in the darkness, a stain that was Jack, detached itself and began to draw away.\n\n\u201cAll right. So long.\u201d\n\nThe stain vanished. Another took its place.\n\nRalph felt his knee against something hard and rocked a charred trunk that was edgy to the touch. He felt the sharp cinders that had been bark push against the back of his knee and knew that Roger had sat down. He felt with his hands and lowered himself beside Roger, while the trunk rocked among invisible ashes. Roger, uncommunicative by nature, said nothing. He offered no opinion on the beast nor told Ralph why he had chosen to come on this mad expedition. He simply sat and rocked the trunk gently. Ralph noticed a rapid and infuriating tapping noise and realized that Roger was banging his silly wooden stick against something.\n\nSo they sat, the rocking, tapping, impervious Roger and Ralph, fuming; round them the close sky was loaded with stars, save where the mountain punched up a hole of blackness.\n\nThere was a slithering noise high above them, the sound of someone taking giant and dangerous strides on rock or ash. Then Jack found them, and was shivering and croaking in a voice they could just recognize as his.\n\n\u201cI saw a thing on top.\u201d\n\nThey heard him blunder against the trunk which rocked violently. He lay silent for a moment, then muttered.\n\n\u201cKeep a good lookout. It may be following.\u201d\n\nA shower of ash pattered round them. Jack sat up.\n\n\u201cI saw a thing bulge on the mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou only imagined it,\u201d said Ralph shakily, \u201cbecause nothing would bulge. Not any sort of creature.\u201d\n\nRoger spoke; they jumped, for they had forgotten him.\n\n\u201cA frog.\u201d\n\nJack giggled and shuddered.\n\n\u201cSome frog. There was a noise too. A kind of \u2018plop\u2019 noise. Then the thing bulged.\u201d\n\nRalph surprised himself, not so much by the quality of his voice, which was even, but by the bravado of its intention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go and look.\u201d\n\nFor the first time since he had first known Jack, Ralph could feel him hesitate.\n\n\u201cNow\u2014?\u201d\n\nHis voice spoke for him.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nHe got off the trunk and led the way across the clinking cinders up into the dark, and the others followed.\n\nNow that his physical voice was silent the inner voice of reason, and other voices too, made themselves heard. Piggy was calling him a kid. Another voice told him not to be a fool; and the darkness and desperate enterprise gave the night a kind of dentist\u2019s chair unreality. As they came to the last slope, Jack and Roger drew near, changed from the ink-stains to distinguishable figures. By common consent they stopped and crouched together. Behind them, on the horizon, was a patch\nof lighter sky where in a moment the moon would rise. The wind roared once in the forest and pushed their rags against them.\n\nRalph stirred.\n\n\u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nThey crept forward, Roger lagging a little. Jack and Ralph turned the shoulder of the mountain together. The glittering lengths of the lagoon lay below them and beyond that a long white smudge that was the reef. Roger joined them.\n\nJack whispered.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s creep forward on hands and knees. Maybe it\u2019s asleep.\u201d\n\nRoger and Ralph moved on, this time leaving Jack in the rear, for all his brave words. They came to the flat top where the rock was hard to hands and knees.\n\nA creature that bulged.\n\nRalph put his hand in the cold, soft ashes of the fire and smothered a cry. His hand and shoulder were twitching from the unlooked-for contact. Green lights of nausea appeared for a moment and ate into the darkness. Roger lay behind him and Jack\u2019s mouth was at his ear.\n\n\u201cOver there, where there used to be a gap in the rock. A sort of hump\u2014see?\u201d\n\nAshes blew into Ralph\u2019s face from the dead fire. He could not see the gap or anything else, because the green lights were opening again and growing, and the top of the mountain was sliding sideways.\n\nOnce more, from a distance, he heard Jack\u2019s whisper.\n\n\u201cScared?\u201d\n\nNot scared so much as paralyzed; hung up there immovable on the top of a diminishing, moving mountain. Jack slid away from him, Roger bumped, fumbled with a hiss of breath, and passed onwards. He heard them whispering.\n\n\u201cCan you see anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2014\u201d\n\nIn front of them, only three or four yards away, was a rock-like hump where no rock should be. Ralph could hear a tiny chattering noise coming from somewhere\u2014 perhaps from his own mouth. He bound himself together with his will, fused his fear and loathing into a hatred, and stood up. He took two leaden steps forward.\n\nBehind them the silver of moon had drawn clear of the horizon. Before them, something like a great ape was sitting asleep with its head between its knees. Then the wind roared in the forest, there was confusion in the darkness and the creature lifted its head, holding toward them the ruin of a face.\n\nRalph found himself taking giant strides among the ashes, heard other creatures crying out and leaping and dared the impossible on the dark slope; presently the mountain was deserted, save for the three abandoned sticks and the thing that bowed.",ge="Piggy looked up miserably from the dawn-pale beach to the dark mountain.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? Really sure, I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you a dozen times now,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cwe saw it.\u201d\n\n\u201cD'you think we're safe down here?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow the hell should I know?\u201d\n\nRalph jerked away from him and walked a few paces along the beach. Jack was kneeling and drawing a circular pattern in the sand with his forefinger. Piggy's voice came to them, hushed.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? Really?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo up and see,\u201d said Jack contemptuously, \u201cand good riddance.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe beast had teeth,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cand big black eyes.\u201d\n\nHe shuddered violently. Piggy took off his one round of glass\nand polished the surface.\n\n\u201cWhat we going to do?\u201d\n\nRalph turned toward the platform. The conch glimmered among the trees, a white blob against the place where the sun would rise. He pushed back his mop.\n\n\n\u201cI don't know.\u201d\n\nHe remembered the panic flight down the mountainside.\n\n\u201cI don't think we'd ever fight a thing that size, honestly, you know. We'd talk but we wouldn't fight a tiger. We'd hide. Even Jack 'ud hide.\u201d\n\nJack still looked at the sand.\n\n\u201cWhat about my hunters?\u201d\n\nSimon came stealing out of the shadows by the shelters. Ralph ignored Jack's question. He pointed to the touch of yellow above the sea.\n\n\u201cAs long as there's light we're brave enough. But then? And now that thing squats by the fire as though it didn't want us to be rescued-\u201d\n\nHe was twisting his hands now, unconsciously. His voice rose.\n\n\u201cSo we can't have a signal fire. . . . We're beaten.\u201d\n\nA point of gold appeared above the sea and at once all the sky lightened.\n\n\u201cWhat about my hunters?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoys armed with sticks.\u201d\n\nJack got to his feet. His face was red as he marched away.\n\nPiggy put on his one glass and looked at Ralph.\n\n\u201cNow you done it. You been rude about his hunters.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh shut up!\u201d\n\nThe sound of the inexpertly blown conch interrupted them. As though he were serenading the rising sun, Jack went on blowing till the shelters were astir and the hunters crept to the platform and the littluns whimpered as now they so frequently did. Ralph rose obediently, and Piggy, and they went to the platform.\n\n\u201cTalk,\u201d said Ralph bitterly, \u201ctalk, talk, talk.\u201d\n\nHe took the conch from Jack.\n\n\u201cThis meeting-\u201d\n\nJack interrupted him.\n\n\u201cI called it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you hadn't called it I should have. You just blew the conch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, isn't that calling it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, take it! Go on-talk!\u201d\n\nRalph thrust the conch into Jack's arms and sat down on the trunk.\n\n\u201cI've called an assembly,\u201d said Jack, \u201cbecause of a lot of things. First, you know now, we've seen the beast. We crawled up. We were only a few feet away. The beast sat up and looked at us.\nI don't know what it does. We don't even know what it is-\u201d\n\n\u201cThe beast comes out of the sea-\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of the dark-\u201d\n\n\u201cTrees-\u201d\n\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d shouted Jack. \u201cYou, listen. The beast is sitting up there, whatever it is--\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it's waiting-\u201d\n\n\u201cHunting-\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, hunting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHunting,\u201d said Jack. He remembered his age-old tremors in the forest.\n\u201cYes. The beast is a hunter. Only- shut up! The next thing is that we couldn't kill it. And the next thing is that Ralph said my hunters are no good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said that!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u201fve got the conch. Ralph thinks you're cowards, running away from the boar and the beast. And that's not all.\u201d\n\nThere was a kind of sigh on the platform as if everyone knew what was coming. Jack's voice went on, tremulous yet determined, pushing against the uncooperative silence.\n\n\u201cHe's like Piggy. He says things like Piggy. He isn't a proper chief.\u201d\n\nJack clutched the conch to him.\n\n\u201cHe's a coward himself.\u201d\n\nFor a moment he paused and then went on.\n\n\u201cOn top, when Roger and me went on-he stayed back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went too!\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter.\u201d\n\nThe two boys glared at each other through screens of hair.\n\n\u201cI went on too,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cthen I ran away. So did you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me a coward then.\u201d\n\nJack turned to the hunters.\n\nHe's not a hunter. He'd never have got us meat. He isn't a prefect and we don't know anything about him. He just gives orders and expects people to obey for nothing. All this talk-\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this talk!\u201d shouted Ralph. \u201cTalk, talk! Who wanted it? Who called the meeting?\u201d\n\nJack turned, red in the face, his chin sunk back. He glowered up under his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cAll right then,\u201d he said in tones of deep meaning, and menace, all right.\u201d\n\nHe held the conch against his chest with one hand and stabbed the air with his index finger.\n\n\u201cWho thinks Ralph oughtn't to be chief?\u201d\n\nHe looked expectantly at the boys ranged round, who had frozen. Under the palms there was deadly silence.\n\n\u201cHands up,\u201d said Jack strongly, \u201cwhoever wants Ralph not to be chief?\u201d\n\nThe silence continued, breathless and heavy and full of shame.\n\nSlowly the red drained from Jack's cheeks, then came back with a painful rush. He licked his lips and turned his head at an\nangle, so that his gaze avoided the embarrassment of linking with another's eye.\n\n\u201cHow many think-\u201d\n\nHis voice tailed off. The hands that held the conch shook. He cleared his throat, and spoke loudly.\n\n\u201cAll right then.\u201d\n\nHe laid the conch with great care in the grass at his feet. The humiliating tears were running from the comer of each eye.\n\n\u201cI\u201fm not going to play any longer. Not with you.\u201d\n\nMost of the boys were looking down now, at the grass or their feet. Jack cleared his throat again.\n\n\u201cI\u201fm not going to be part of Ralph\u201fs lot-\u201d\n\nHe looked along the right-hand logs, numbering the hunters that had been a choir.\n\n\u201cI\u201fm going off by myself. He can catch his own pigs. Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.\u201d\n\nHe blundered out of the triangle toward the drop to the white sand.\n\n\u201cJack!\u201d\n\nJack turned and looked back at Ralph. For a moment he paused and then cried out, highpitched, enraged.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\nHe leapt down from the platform and ran along the beach, paying no heed to the steady fall of his tears; and until he dived into the forest Ralph watched him.\n\nPiggy was indignant.\n\n\u201cI been talking, Ralph, and you just stood there like-\u201d\n\nSoftly, looking at Piggy and not seeing him, Ralph spoke to himself.\n\n\u201cHe\u201fll come back. When the sun goes down he\u201fll come.\u201d He looked at the conch in Piggy's hand.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell there!\u201d\n\nPiggy gave up the attempt to rebuke Ralph. He polished his glass again and went back to his subject.\n\n\u201cWe can do without Jack Merridew. There's others besides him on this island. But now we really got a beast, though I can't hardly believe it, well need to stay close to the platform; there'll\nbe less need of him and his hunting. So now we can really decide on what's what.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's no help, Piggy. Nothing to be done.\u201d\n\nFor a while they sat in depressed silence. Then Simon stood up and took the conch from Piggy, who was so astonished that he remained on his feet. Ralph looked up at Simon.\n\n\u201cSimon? What is it this time?\u201d\n\nA half-sound of jeering ran round the circle and Simon shrank from it.\n\n\u201cI thought there might be something to do. Something we-\u201d\n\nAgain the pressure of the assembly took his voice away. He sought for help and sympathy and chose Piggy. He turned half toward him, clutching the conch to his brown chest.\n\n\u201cI think we ought to climb the mountain.\u201d\n\nThe circle shivered with dread. Simon broke off and turned to Piggy who was looking at him with an expression of derisive incomprehension.\n\n\u201cWhat's the good of climbing up to this here beast when Ralph and the other two couldn't do nothing?\u201d\n\nSimon whispered his answer.\n\n\u201cWhat else is there to do?\u201d\n\nHis speech made, he allowed Piggy to lift the conch out of his hands. Then he retired and sat as far away from the others as possible.\n\nPiggy was speaking now with more assurance and with what, if the circumstances had not been so serious, the others would have recognized as pleasure.\n\n\u201cI said we could all do without a certain person. Now I say we got to decide on what can be done. And I think I could tell you what Ralph's going to say next. The most important thing on\nthe island is the smoke and you can\u201ft have no smoke without a fire.\u201d\n\nRalph made a restless movement.\n\n\u201cNo go, Piggy. We've got no fire. That thing sits up there- we'll have to stay here.\u201d\n\nPiggy lifted the conch as though to add power to his next words.\n\n\u201cWe got no fire on the mountain. But what's wrong with a fire down here? A fire could be built on them rocks. On the sand, even. We'd make smoke just the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's right!\u201d\n\n\u201cSmoke!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the bathing pool!\u201d\n\nThe boys began to babble. Only Piggy could have the intellectual daring to suggest moving the fire from the mountain.\n\n\u201cSo well have the fire down here,\u201d said Ralph. He looked about him. \u201cWe can build it just here between the bathing pool and the platform. Of course-\u201d\n\nHe broke off, frowning, thinking the thing out, unconsciously tugging at the stub of a nail with his teeth.\n\n\u201cOf course the smoke won't show so much, not be seen so far away. But we needn't go near, near the-\u201d\n\nThe others nodded in perfect comprehension. There would be no need to go near.\n\n\u201cWe\u201fll build the fire now.\u201d\n\nThe greatest ideas are the simplest Now there was something to be done they worked with passion. Piggy was so full of delight and expanding liberty in Jack's departure, so full of pride in his contribution to the good of society, that he helped to fetch wood.\n\nThe wood he fetched was close at hand, a fallen tree on the platform that they did not need for the assembly, yet to the\nothers the sanctity of the platform had protected even what was useless there. Then the twins realized they would have a fire near them as a comfort in the night and this set a few littluns dancing and clapping hands.\n\nThe wood was not so dry as the fuel they had used on the mountain. Much of it was damply rotten and full of insects that scurried; logs had to be lined from the soil with care or they\ncrumbled into sodden powder. More than this, in order to avoid going deep into the forest the boys worked near at hand on any fallen wood no matter how tangled with new growth. The skirts\nof the forest and the scar were familiar, near the conch and the shelters and sufficiently friendly in daylight. What they might become in darkness nobody cared to think. They worked therefore with great energy and cheerfulness, though as time crept by there was a suggestion of panic in the energy and hysteria in the cheerfulness. They built a pyramid of leaves and twigs, branches and togs, on the bare sand by the platform. For the first time on the island, Piggy himself removed his one glass, knelt down and focused the sun on tinder. Soon there was a ceiling of smoke and a bush of yellow flame. The littluns who had seen few fires since the first catastrophe became wildly excited. They danced and sang and there was a partyish air about the gathering.\n\nAt last Ralph stopped work and stood up, smudging the sweat from his face with a dirty forearm.\n\n\u201cWe'll have to have a small fire. This one's too big to keep up.\u201d\n\nPiggy sat down carefully on the sand and began to polish his glass.\n\n\u201cWe could experiment. We could find out how to make a small hot fire and then put green branches on to make smoke. Some of them leaves must be better for that than the others.\u201d\n\nAs the fire died down so did the excitement. The littluns stopped singing and dancing and drifted away toward the sea or the fruit trees or the shelters.\n\nRalph flopped down in the sand.\n\n\u201cWe'll have to make a new list of who's to took after the fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can find 'em.\u201d\n\nHe looked round. Then for the first time he saw how few biguns there were and understood why the work had been so hard.\n\n\u201cWhere\u201fs Maurice?\u201d\n\nPiggy wiped his glass again.\n\n\u201cI expect ... no, he wouldn't go into the forest by himself, would he?\u201d\n\nRalph jumped up, ran swiftly round the fire and stood by Piggy, holding up his hair.\n\n\u201cBut we've got to have a list! There's you and me and Samneric and-\u201d\n\nHe would not look at Piggy but spoke casually.\n\n\u201cWhere's Bill and Roger?\u201d\n\nPiggy leaned forward and put a fragment of wood on the fire.\n\n\u201cI expect they've gone. I expect they won't play either.\u201d\n\nRalph sat down and began to poke little holes in the sand. He was surprised to see that one had a drop of blood by it He examined his bitten nail closely and watched the little globe of blood that gathered where the quick was gnawed away.\n\nPiggy went on speaking.\n\n\u201cI seen them stealing off when we was gathering wood. They went that way. The same way as he went himself.\u201d\n\nRalph finished his inspection and looked up into the air. The sky, as if in sympathy with the great changes among them, was different today and so misty that in some places the hot air\nseemed white. The disc of the sun was dull silver as though it were nearer and not so hot, yet the air stifled.\n\n\u201cThey always been making trouble, haven't they?\u201d\n\nThe voice came near his shoulder and sounded anxious.\n\n\u201cWe can do without 'em. We'll be happier now, won't we?\u201d\n\nRalph sat. The twins came, dragging a great log and grinning in their triumph. They dumped the log among the embers so that sparks flew.\n\n\u201cWe can do all right on our own, can't we?\u201d\n\nFor a long time while the log dried, caught fire and turned red hot, Ralph sat in the sand and said nothing. He did not see Piggy go to the twins and whisper with them, nor how the three boys went together into the forest.\n\n\u201cHere you are.\u201d\n\nHe came to himself with a jolt. Piggy and the other two were by him. They were laden with fruit.\n\n\u201cI thought perhaps,\u201d said Piggy, \u201cwe ought to have a feast, kind of.\u201d\n\nThe three boys sat down. They had a great mass of the fruit with them and all of it properly ripe. They grinned at Ralph as he took some and began to eat.\n\n\"Thanks,\u201d he said. Then with an accent of pleased surprise, \u201dThanks!\u201d\n\u201cDo all right on our own,\u201d said Piggy. \u201cIt's them that haven't no common sense that make trouble on this island. We'll make a little hot fire-\u201d\n\nRalph remembered what had been worrying him.\n\n\u201cWhere's Simon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't think he's climbing the mountain?\u201d\n\nPiggy broke into noisy laughter and took more fruit.\n\n\u201cHe might be.\u201d He gulped his mouthful. \u201cHe's cracked.\u201d\n\nSimon had passed through the area of fruit trees but today the littluns had been too busy with the fire on the beach and they had not pursued him there. He went on among the creepers until he reached the great mat that was woven by the open space and crawled inside.\n\nBeyond the screen of leaves the sunlight pelted down and the butterflies danced in the middle their unending dance. He knelt down and the arrow of the sun fell on him. That other time the air had seemed to vibrate with heat; but now it threatened. Soon the sweat was running from his long coarse hair. He\nshifted restlessly but there was no avoiding the sun. Presently he was thirsty, and then very thirsty.\n\nHe continued to sit.\nFar off alone the beach, Jack was standing before a small group of boys. He was looking brilliantly happy.\n\n\u201cHunting,\u201d he said. He sized them up. Each of them wore the remains of a black cap and ages ago they had stood in two demure rows and their voices had been the song of angels.\n\n\u201cWe'll hunt. I'm going to be chief.\u201d\n\nThey nodded, and the crisis passed easily.\n\n\u201cAnd then- about the beast.\u201d\n\nThey moved, looked at the forest.\n\n\u201cI say this. We aren't going to bother about the beast.\u201d\n\nHe nodded at them.\n\n\u201cWe're going to forget the beast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's right!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cForget the beast!\u201d\n\nIf Jack was astonished by their fervor he did not show it.\n\n\u201cAnd another thing. We shan't dream so much down here. This is near the end of the island.\u201d\n\nThey agreed passionately out of the depths of their tormented private lives.\n\n\u201cNow listen. We might go later to the castle rock. But now I'm going to get more of the biguns away from the conch and all that We'll kill a pig and give a feast.\u201d\n\nHe paused and went on more slowly.\n\n\u201cAnd about the beast. When we kill we'll leave some of the kill for it. Then it won't bother us, maybe.\u201d\n\nHe stood up abruptly.\n\n\u201cWe'll go into the forest now and hunt.\u201d\n\nHe turned and trotted away and after a moment they followed him obediently.\n\nThey spread out, nervously, in the forest. Almost at once Jack found the dung and scattered roots that told of pig and soon the track was fresh. Jack signaled the rest of the hunt to be quiet and went forward by himself. He was happy and wore the damp darkness of the forest like his old clothes. He crept down a slope to rocks and scattered trees by the sea.\n\nThe pigs lay, bloated bags of fat, sensuously enjoying the shadows under the trees. There was no wind and they were unsuspicious; and practice had made Jack silent as the shadows. He stole away again and instructed his hidden hunters. Presently they all began to inch forward sweating\nin the silence and heat. Under the trees an ear flapped idly. A little apart from the rest, sunk in deep maternal bliss, lay the largest sow of the lot. She was black and pink; and the great bladder of her belly was fringed with a row of piglets that slept or burrowed and squeaked.\n\nFifteen yards from the drove Jack stopped, and his arm, straightening, pointed at the sow. he looked round in inquiry to make sure that everyone understood and the other boys nodded at him. The row of right arms slid back.\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d\n\nThe drove of pigs started up; and at a range of only ten yards the wooden spears with firehardened points flew toward the chosen pig. One piglet, with a demented shriek, rushed into the\nsea trailing Roger's spear behind it. The sow gave a gasping squeal and staggered up, with two spears sticking in her fat flank. The boys shouted and rushed forward, the piglets scattered and the sow burst the advancing line and went crashing away through the forest.\n\n\u201cAfter her!\u201d\n\nThey raced along the pig-track, but the forest was too dark and tangled so that Jack, cursing, stopped them and cast among the trees. Then he said nothing for a time but breathed fiercely so that they were awed by him and looked at each other in uneasy admiration. Presently he stabbed down at the ground with his finger.\n\n\u201cThere-\u201d\nBefore the others could examine the drop of blood, Jack had swerved off, judging a trace, touching a bough that gave. So he followed, mysteriously right and assured, and the hunters trod\nbehind him.\n\nHe stopped before a covert.\n\n\u201cIn there.\u201d\n\nThey surrounded the covert but the sow got away with the sting of another spear in her flank. The trailing butts hindered her and the sharp, cross-cut points were a torment She blundered into a tree, forcing a spear still deeper; and after that any of the hunters could follow her easily by the drops of vivid blood. The afternoon wore on, hazy and dreadful with damp heat; the sow staggered her way ahead of them, bleeding and mad, and the hunters followed, wedded to her in lust, excited by the long chase and the dropped blood. They could see her now, nearly got up with her, out she spurted with her last strength and held ahead of them again. They were just behind her when she staggered into an open space where bright flowers grew and butterflies danced round each other and the air was hot and still.\n\nHere, struck down by the heat, the sow fell and the hunters hurled themselves at her. This dreadful eruption from an unknown world made her frantic; she squealed and bucked and the air was full of sweat and noise and blood and terror. Roger ran round the heap, prodding with his spear whenever pigflesh appeared. Jack was on top of the sow, stabbing downward with his knife. Roger found a lodgment for his point and began to push till he was leaning with his whole weight The spear moved forward inch by inch and die terrified squealing became a high-pitched scream. Then Jack found the throat and the hot blood spouted over his hands. The sow collapsed under them and they were heavy and fulfilled upon her. The butterflies still danced, preoccupied in the center of die clearing.\n\nAt last the immediacy of the kill subsided. The boys drew back, and Jack stood up, holding out his hands.\n\n\u201cLook.\u201d\n\nHe giggled and flicked them while the boys laughed at his reeking palms. Then Jack grabbed Maurice and rubbed the stuff over his cheeks. Roger began to withdraw his spear and the boys noticed it for the first time. Robert stabilized the thing in a phrase which was received uproariously.\n\n\u201cRight up her ass!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hear?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hear what he said?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight up her ass!\u201d\n\nThis time Robert and Maurice acted the two parts; and Maurice's acting of the pig's efforts to avoid the advancing spear was so funny that the boys cried with laughter.\n\nAt length even this palled. Jack began to clean his bloody hands on the rock. Then he started work on the sow and paunched her, lugging out the hot bags of colored guts, pushing them into a pile on the rock while the others watched him. He talked as he worked.\n\n\u201cWe'll take the meat along the beach. I'll go back to the platform and invite them to a feast. That should give us time.\u201d\n\nRoger spoke.\n\n\u201cChief-\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we make a fire?\u201d\n\nJack squatted back and frowned at the pig.\n\n\u201cWe'll raid them and take fire. There must be four of you; Henry and you, Bill and Maurice. We'll put on paint and sneak up; Roger can snatch a branch while I say what I want. The rest of you can get this back to where we were. We'll build the fire there. And after that-\u201d\n\nHe paused and stood up, looking at the shadows under the trees. His voice was lower when he spoke again.\n\n\u201cBut we'll leave part of the kill for ...\u201d\n\nHe knelt down again and was busy with his knife. The boys crowded round him. He spoke over his shoulder to Roger.\n\n\u201cSharpen a stick at both ends.\u201d\n\nPresently he stood up, holding the dripping sow's head in his hands.\n\n\u201cWhere's that stick?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere.\u201d\n\n\u201cRam one end in the earth. Oh- it's rock. Jam it in that crack. There.\u201d\n\nJack held up the head and jammed the soft throat down on the pointed end of the stick which pierced through into the mouth. He stood back and the head hung there, a little blood dribbling\ndown the stick.\n\nInstinctively the boys drew back too; and the forest was very still. They listened, and the loudest noise was the buzzing of flies over the spilled guts.\n\nJack spoke in a whisper.\n\n\"Pick up the pig.\u201d\n\nMaurice and Robert skewered the carcass, lifted the dead weight, and stood ready. In the silence, and standing over the dry blood, they looked suddenly furtive.\n\nJack spoke loudly.\n\n\u201cThis head is for the beast. It's a gift.\u201d\n\nThe silence accepted the gift and awed them. The head remained there, dim-eyed, grinning faintly, blood blackening between the teeth. All at once they were running away, as fast as they could, through the forest toward the open beach.\n\nSimon stayed where he was, a small brown image, concealed by the leaves. Even if he shut his eyes the sow's head still remained like an after-image. The half-shut eyes were dim with the infinite cynicism of adult life. They assured Simon that everything was a bad business.\n\n\u201cI know that.\u201d\n\nSimon discovered that he had spoken aloud. He opened his eyes quickly and there was the head grinning amusedly in the strange daylight, ignoring the flies, the spilled guts, even ignoring the indignity of being spiked on a stick.\n\nHe looked away, licking his dry lips.\n\nA gift for the beast. Might not the beast come for it? The head, he thought, appeared to agree with him. Run away, said the head silently, go back to the others. It was a joke really-why should you bother? You were just wrong, that's all. A little headache, something you ate, perhaps. Go back, child, said the head silently.\n\nSimon looked up, feeling the weight of his wet hair, and gazed at the sky. Up there, for once, were clouds, great bulging towers that sprouted away over the island, grey and cream and\ncopper-colored. The clouds were sitting on the land; they squeezed, produced moment by moment this close, tormenting heat. Even the butterflies deserted the open space where the obscene thing grinned and dripped. Simon lowered his head, carefully keeping his eyes shut, then sheltered them with his hand. There were no shadows under the trees but everywhere a pearly stillness, so that what was real seemed illusive and without definition. The pile of guts was a black blob of flies that buzzed like a saw. After a while these flies found Simon. Gorged, they alighted by his runnels of sweat and drank. They tickled under his nostrils and played leapfrog on his thighs. They were black and iridescent green and without number; and in front of Simon, the Lord of the Flies hung on his stick and grinned. At last Simon gave up and looked back; saw the white teeth and dim eyes, the blood-and his gaze was held by that ancient, inescapable recognition. In Simon's right temple, a pulse began to beat on the brain.\n\nRalph and Piggy lay in the sand, gazing at the fire and idly flicking pebbles into its smokeless heart.\n\n\u201cThat branch is gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere's Samneric?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ought to get some more wood. We're out of green branches.\u201d\n\nRalph sighed and stood up. There were no shadows under the palms on the platform; only this strange light that seemed to come from everywhere at once. High up among the bulging clouds thunder went off like a gun.\n\n\u201cWe're going to get buckets of rain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the fire?\u201d\n\nRalph trotted into the forest and returned with a wide spray of green which he dumped on the fire. The branch crackled, the leaves curled and the yellow smoke expanded.\n\nPiggy made an aimless little pattern in the sand with his fingers.\n\n\u201cTrouble is, we haven't got enough people for a fire. You got to treat Samneric as one turn. They do everything together-\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that isn't fair. Don't you see? They ought to do two turns.\u201d\n\nRalph considered this and understood. He was vexed to find how little he thought like a grownup and sighed again. The island was getting worse and worse.\n\nPiggy looked at the fire.\n\n\u201cYou'll want another green branch soon.\u201d\n\nRalph rolled over.\n\n\u201cPiggy. What are we going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust have to get on without 'em.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut- the fire.\u201d\n\nHe frowned at the black and white mess in which lay the unburnt ends of branches. He tried to formulate.\n\n\u201cI\u201fm scared.\u201d\n\nHe saw Piggy look up; and blundered on.\n\n\u201cNot of the beast. I mean I'm scared of that too. But nobody else understands about the fire. If someone threw you a rope when you were drowning. If a doctor said take this because if you don't take it you'll die- you would, wouldn't you? I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cCourse I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan't they see? Can't they understand? Without the smoke signal we'll die here? Look at that!\u201d\n\nA wave of heated air trembled above the ashes but without a trace of smoke.\n\n\u201cWe can't keep one fire going. And they don't care. And what's more-\u201d\nHe looked intensely into Piggy's streaming face.\n\n\u201cWhat's more, I don't sometimes. Supposing I got like the others- not caring. What 'ud become of us?\u201d\n\nPiggy took off his glasses, deeply troubled.\n\n\u201cI dunno, Ralph. We just got to go on, that's all. That's what grownups would do.\u201d\n\nRalph, having begun the business of unburdening himself,\ncontinued.\n\n\u201cPiggy, what's wrong?\u201d\n\nPiggy looked at him in astonishment.\n\n\u201cDo you mean the- ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not it ... I mean . . . what makes things break up like they do?\u201d\n\nPiggy rubbed his glasses slowly and thought. When he understood how far Ralph had gone toward accepting him he flushed pinkly with pride.\n\n\u201cI dunno, Ralph. I expect it's him.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack?\u201d\n\n\u201cJack.\u201d\nA taboo was evolving round that word too.\n\nRalph nodded solemnly.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI suppose it must be.\u201d\n\nThe forest near them burst into uproar. Demoniac figures with faces of white and red and green rushed out howling, so that the littluns fled screaming. Out of the corner of his eye, Ralph saw Piggy running. Two figures rushed at the fire and he prepared to defend himself but they grabbed half-burnt branches and raced away along the beach. The three others stood still, watching Ralph; and he saw that the tallest of them, stark naked save for paint and a belt, was Jack.\n\nRalph had his breath back and spoke.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\nJack ignored him, lifted his spear and began to shout.\n\n\u201cListen all of you. Me and my hunters, we're living along the beach by a flat rock. We hunt and feast and have fun. If you want to join my tribe come and see us. Perhaps I'll let you join.\nPerhaps not.\u201d\n\nHe paused and looked round. He was safe from shame or self-consciousness behind the mask of his paint and could look at each of them in turn. Ralph was kneeling by the remains of the fire like a sprinter at his mark and his face was half-hidden by hair and smut. Samneric peered together round a palm tree at the edge of the forest A littlun howled, creased and crimson, by the bathing pool and Piggy stood on the platform, the white conch gripped in his hands.\n\n\u201cTonight we're having a feast. We've killed a pig and we've got meat. You can come and eat with us if you like.\u201d\n\nUp in the cloud canyons the thunder boomed again. Jack and the two anonymous savages with him swayed, looking up, and then recovered. The littlun went on howling. Jack was waiting for something. He whispered urgently to the others.\n\n\u201cGo on- now!\u201d\n\nThe two savages murmured. Jack spoke sharply.\n\n\u201cGo on!\u201d The two savages looked at each other, raised their spears together and spoke in time.\n\n\u201cThe Chief has spoken.\u201d\n\nThen the three of them turned and trotted away.\n\nPresently Ralph rose to his feet, looking at the place where the savages had vanished. Samneric came, talking in an awed whisper.\n\n\u201cI thought it was-\u201d\n\n\u201c-and I was-\u201d\n\n\u201c-scared.\u201d\n\nPiggy stood above them on the platform, still holding the conch.\n\n\u201cThat was Jack and Maurice and Robert,\u201d said Ralph. \u201cAren't they having fun?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to have asthma.\u201d\n\n\u201cSucks to your ass-mar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I saw Jack I was sure he'd go for the conch. Can't think why.\u201d\n\nThe group of boys looked at the white shell with affectionate respect. Piggy placed it in Ralph's hands and the littluns, seeing the familiar symbol, started to come back.\n\n\u201cNot here.\u201d\n\nHe turned toward the platform, feeling the need for ritual. First went Ralph, the white conch cradled, then Piggy very grave, then the twins, then the littluns and the others.\n\n\u201cSit down all of you. They raided us for fire. They're having fun. But the-\u201d\n\nRalph was puzzled by the shutter that flickered in his brain.\n\nThere was something he wanted to say; then the shutter had come down.\n\u201cBut the-\"\n\nThey were regarding him gravely, not yet troubled by any doubts about his sufficiency. Ralph pushed the idiot hair out of his eyes and looked at Piggy.\n\n\u201cBut the ... oh ... the fire! Of course, the fire!\u201d\n\nHe started to laugh, then stopped and became fluent instead.\n\n\u201cThe fire's the most important thing. Without the fire we can't be rescued. I'd like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning. The fire's the most important thing on the island, because, because-\u201d\n\nHe paused again and the silence became full of doubt and wonder.\n\nPiggy whispered urgently. \u201cRescue.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes. Without the fire we can't be rescued. So we must stay by the fire and make smoke.\u201d\n\nWhen he stopped no one said anything. After the many brilliant speeches that had been made on this very spot Ralph's remarks seemed lame, even to the littluns. At last Bill held out his hands for the conch.\n\n\u201cNow we can't have the fire up there-because we can't have the fire up there- we need more people to keep it going. Let's go to this feast and tell them the fire's hard on the rest of us. And the hunting and all that, being savages I mean-it must be jolly good fun.\u201d\n\nSamneric took the conch.\n\n\u201cThat must be fun like Bill says- and as he's invited us-\u201d\n\n\u201c-to a feast-\u201d\n\n\u201c-meat-\u201d\n\n\u201c-crackling-\u201d\n\n\u201c-I could do with some meat-\u201d\n\nRalph held up his hand.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn't we get our own meat?\u201d\n\nThe twins looked at each other. Bill answered.\n\n\u201cWe don't want to go in the jungle.\u201d\n\nRalph grimaced.\n\n\u201cHe- you know- goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe's a hunter. They're all hunters. That\u201fs different.\u201d\n\nNo one spoke for a moment, then Piggy muttered to the sand.\n\n\u201cMeat-\u201d\n\nThe littluns sat, solemnly thinking of meat, and dribbling.\n\nOverhead the cannon boomed again and the dry palm fronds clattered in a sudden gust of hot wind.\n\n\u201cYou are a silly little boy,\u201d said the Lord of the Flies, \u201cjust an ignorant, silly little boy.\u201d\n\nSimon moved his swollen tongue but said nothing.\n\n\u201cDon't you agree?\u201d said the Lord of the Flies. \u201cAren't you just a silly little boy?\u201d\n\nSimon answered him in the same silent voice.\n\n\u201cWell then,\u201d said the Lord of the Flies, \u201cyou'd better run off and play with the others. They think you're batty. You don't want Ralph to think you're batty, do you? You like Ralph a lot, don't you? And Piggy, and Jack?\u201d\n\nSimon's head was tilted slightly up. His eyes could not break away and the Lord of the Flies hung in space before him.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here all alone? Aren't you afraid of me?\u201d\nSimon shook.\n\n\u201cThere isn't anyone to help you. Only me. And I'm the Beast.\u201d\n\nSimon\u201fs mouth labored, brought forth audible words.\n\n\u201cPig's head on a stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cFancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!\u201d said the head.\n\nFor a moment or two the forest and all the other dimly appreciated places echoed with the parody of laughter.\n\n\u201cYou knew, didn't you? I'm part of you? Close, close, close! I'm the reason why it's no go? Why things are what they are?\u201d\n\nThe laughter shivered again.\n\n\u201cCome now,\u201d said the Lord of the Flies. \u201cGet back to the others and we'll forget the whole thing.\u201d\n\nSimon's head wobbled. His eyes were half closed as though he were imitating the obscene thing on the stick. He knew that one of his times was coming on. The Lord of the Flies was\nexpanding like a balloon.\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. You know perfectly well you'll only meet me down there-so don't try to escape!\u201d\n\nSimon\u201fs body was arched and stiff. The Lord of the Flies spoke in the voice of a schoolmaster.\n\n\u201cThis has gone quite far enough. My poor, misguided child, do you think you know better than I do?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\u201cI'm warning you. I'm going to get angry. D'you see? You're not wanted. Understand? We are going to have fun on this island. Understand? We are going to have fun on this island! So don't\ntry it on, my poor misguided boy, or else-\u201d\n\nSimon found he was looking into a vast mouth. There was blackness within, a blackness that spread.\n\u201c-Or else,\u201d said the Lord of the Flies, \u201cwe shall do you. See? Jack and Roger and Maurice and Robert and Bill and Piggy and Ralph. Do you. See?\u201d\n\nSimon was inside the mouth. He fell down and lost consciousness.",we="Over the island the build-up of clouds continued. A steady current of heated air rose all day from the mountain and was thrust to ten thousand feet; revolving masses of gas piled up the static until the air was ready to explode. By early evening the sun had gone and a brassy glare had taken the place of clear daylight. Even the air that pushed in from the sea was hot and held no refreshment. Colors drained from water and trees and pink surfaces of rock, and the white and brown clouds brooded. Nothing prospered but the flies who blackened their lord and made the split guts look like a heap of glistening coal. Even when the vessel broke in Simon\u2019s nose and the blood gushed out they left him alone, preferring the pig\u2019s high flavor. With the running of the blood Simon\u2019s fit passed into the weariness of sleep. He lay in the mat of creepers while the evening advanced and the cannon continued to play. At last he woke and saw dimly the dark earth close by his cheek. Still he did not move but lay there, his face sideways on the earth, his eyes looking dully before him. Then he turned over, drew his feet under him and laid hold of the creepers to pull himself up.\n\nWhen the creepers shook the flies exploded from the guts with a vicious note and clamped back on again. Simon got to his feet. The light was unearthly. The Lord of the Flies hung on his stick like a black ball. Simon spoke aloud to the clearing.\n\n\u201cWhat else is there to do?\u201d\n\nNothing replied. Simon turned away from the open space and crawled through the creepers till he was in the dusk of the forest. He walked drearily between the trunks, his face empty of expression, and the blood was dry round his mouth and chin. Only sometimes as he lifted the ropes of creeper aside and chose his direction from the trend of the land, he\nmouthed words that did not reach the air. Presently the creepers festooned the trees less frequently and there was\na scatter of pearly light from the sky down through the trees. This was the backbone of the island, the slightly higher land that lay beneath the mountain where the forest was no longer deep jungle. Here there were wide spaces interspersed with thickets and huge trees and the trend of the ground led him up as the forest opened. He pushed on, staggering sometimes with his weariness but never stopping. The usual brightness was gone from his eyes and he walked with a sort of glum determination like an old man.\n\nA buffet of wind made him stagger and he saw that he was out in the open, on rock, under a brassy sky. He found his legs were weak and his tongue gave him pain all the time. When the wind reached the mountaintop he could see something happen, a flicker of blue stuff against brown clouds. He pushed himself forward and the wind came again, stronger now, cuffing the forest heads till they ducked and roared. Simon saw a humped thing suddenly sit up on the top and look down at him. He hid his face, and toiled on.The flies had found the figure too. The life-like movement would scare them off for a moment so that they made a dark cloud round the head. Then as the blue material of the parachute collapsed the corpulent figure would bow forward, sighing, and the flies settle once more.\n\nSimon felt his knees smack the rock. He crawled forward and soon he understood. The tangle of lines showed him the mechanics of this parody; he examined the white nasal bones, the teeth, the colors of corruption. He saw how pitilessly the layers of rubber and canvas held together the poor body that should be rotting away. Then the wind blew again and the figure lifted, bowed, and breathed foully at him. Simon knelt on all fours and was sick till his stomach was empty. Then he took the lines in his hands; he freed them from the rocks and the figure from the wind\u2019s indignity. At last he turned away and looked down at the beaches. The fire by the platform appeared to be out, or at least making no smoke. Further along the beach, beyond the little river and near a great slab of rock, a\nthin trickle of smoke was climbing into the sky. Simon, forgetful of the flies, shaded his eyes with both hands and peered at the smoke. Even at that distance it was possible to see that most of the boys\u2014perhaps all of the boys\u2014were there. So they had shifted camp then, away from the beast. As Simon thought this, he turned to the poor broken thing that sat stinking by his side. The beast was harmless and horrible; and the news must reach the others as soon as possible. He started down the mountain and his legs gave beneath him. Even with great care the best he could do was a stagger.\n\n\u201cBathing,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cthat\u2019s the only thing to do.\u201d Piggy was inspecting the looming-sky through his glass. \u201cI don\u2019t like them clouds. Remember how it rained just after we landed?\u201d \u201cGoing to rain again.\u201d Ralph dived into the pool. A couple of littluns were playing at the edge, trying to extract comfort from a wetness warmer than blood. Piggy took off his glasses, stepped primly into the water and then put them on again. Ralph came to the surface and squirted a jet of water at him.\n\n\u201cMind my specs,\u201d said Piggy. \u201cIf I get water on the glass I got to get out and clean \u2019em.\u201d\n\nRalph squirted again and missed. He laughed at Piggy, expecting him to retire meekly as usual and in pained silence. Instead, Piggy beat the water with his hands. \u201cStop it!\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you hear?\u201d Furiously he drove the water into Ralph\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d said Ralph. \u201cKeep your hair on.\u201d Piggy stopped beating the water.\n\n\u201cI got a pain in my head. I wish the air was cooler.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the rain would come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish we could go home.\u201d Piggy lay back against the sloping sand side of the pool. His stomach protruded and the water dried on it. Ralph squinted up at the sky. One could guess at the movement of the sun by the progress of a light patch among the clouds. He knelt in the water and looked round.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s everybody?\u201d Piggy sat up.\n\n\u201cP\u2019raps they\u2019re lying in the shelter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Samneric?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Bill?\u201d Piggy pointed beyond the platform.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where they\u2019ve gone. Jack\u2019s party.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them go,\u201d said Ralph, uneasily, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust for some meat\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for hunting,\u201d said Ralph, wisely, \u201cand for pretending to be a tribe, and putting on war-paint.\u201d\n\nPiggy stirred the sand under water and did not look at Ralph. \u201cP\u2019raps we ought to go too.\u201d Ralph looked at him quickly and Piggy blushed. \u201cI mean\u2014to make sure nothing happens.\u201d\n\nRalph squirted water again. Long before Ralph and Piggy came up with Jack\u2019s lot, they could hear the party. There was a stretch of grass in a place where the palms left a wide band of turf between the forest and the shore. Just one step down from the edge of the turf was the white, blown sand of above high water, warm, dry, trodden. Below that again was a rock that stretched away toward the lagoon. Beyond was a short stretch of sand and then the edge of the water. A fire burned on the rock and fat dripped from the roasting pigmeat into the invisible flames. All the boys of the island, except Piggy, Ralph, Simon, and the two tending the pig, were grouped on the turf. They were laughing, singing, lying, squatting, or standing\non the grass, holding food in their hands. But to judge by the greasy faces, the meat eating was almost done; and some held coconut shells in their hands and were drinking from them. Before the party had started a great log had been dragged into the center of the lawn and Jack, painted and garlanded, sat there like an idol. There were piles of meat on green leaves near him, and fruit, and coconut shells full of drink. Piggy and Ralph came to the edge of the grassy platform; and the boys,\nas they noticed them, fell silent one by one till only the boy next to Jack was talking. Then the silence intruded even there and Jack turned where he sat. For a time he looked at them and the crackle of the fire was the loudest noise over the droning of the reef. Ralph looked away; and Sam, thinking that Ralph had turned to him accusingly, put down his gnawed bone with a nervous giggle. Ralph took an uncertain step, pointed to a palm tree, and whispered something inaudible to Piggy; and they both giggled like Sam. Lifting his feet high out of the sand, Ralph started to stroll past. Piggy tried to whistle. At this moment the boys who were cooking at the fire suddenly hauled off a great chunk of meat and ran with it toward the grass. They bumped Piggy, who was burnt, and yelled and danced. Immediately, Ralph and the crowd of boys were united and relieved by a storm of laughter. Piggy once more was the center of social derision so that everyone felt cheerful and normal. Jack stood up and waved his spear.\n\n\n\u201cTake them some meat.\u201d The boys with the spit gave Ralph and Piggy each succulent chunk. They took the gift, dribbling. So they stood and ate beneath a sky of thunderous brass that rang with the storm-coming.\n\nJack waved his spear again. \u201cHas everybody eaten as much as they want?\u201d There was still food left, sizzling on the wooden spits, heaped on the green platters. Betrayed by his stomach, Piggy threw a picked bone down on the beach and stooped for more. Jack spoke again, impatiently. \u201cHas everybody eaten as much as they want?\u201d His tone conveyed a warning, given out of the pride of ownership, and the boys ate faster while there was still time. Seeing there was no immediate likelihood of a pause, Jack rose from the log that was his throne and sauntered to the edge of the grass. He looked down from behind his paint at Ralph and Piggy. They moved a little farther off over the sand and Ralph watched the fire as he ate. He noticed, without understanding, how the flames were visible now against the dull light. Evening was come, not with calm beauty but with the threat of violence.\n\nJack spoke. \u201cGive me a drink.\u201d\n\nHenry brought him a shell and he drank, watching Piggy and Ralph over the jagged rim. Power lay in the brown swell of his forearms: authority sat on his shoulder and chattered in his ear like an ape. \u201cAll sit down.\u201d\n\nThe boys ranged themselves in rows on the grass before him but Ralph and Piggy stayed a foot lower, standing on the soft sand. Jack ignored them for the moment, turned his mask down to the seated boys and pointed at them with the spear.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to join my tribe?\u201d Ralph made a sudden movement that became a stumble. Some of the boys turned toward him. \u201cI gave you food,\u201d said Jack, \u201cand my hunters will protect you from the beast. Who will join my tribe?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m chief,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cbecause you chose me. And we were going to keep the fire going. Now you run after food\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ran yourself!\u201d shouted Jack. \u201cLook at that bone in your hands!\u201d\n\nRalph went crimson.\n\n\u201cI said you were hunters. That was your job.\u201d\nJack ignored him again.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019ll join my tribe and have fun?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m chief,\u201d said Ralph tremulously. \u201cAnd what about the fire? And I\u2019ve got the conch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got it with you,\u201d said Jack, sneering. \u201cYou left it behind. See, clever? And the conch doesn\u2019t count at this end of the island\u2014\u201d\n\nAll at once the thunder struck. Instead of the dull boom there was a point of impact in the explosion.\n\n\u201cThe conch counts here too,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cand all over the island.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do about it then?\u201d\nRalph examined the ranks of boys. There was no help in them and he looked away, confused and sweating. Piggy whispered.\n\n\u201cThe fire\u2014rescue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019ll join my tribe?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll blow the conch,\u201d said Ralph breathlessly, \u201cand call an assembly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shan\u2019t hear it.\u201d\n\nPiggy touched Ralph\u2019s wrist.\n\n\u201cCome away. There\u2019s going to be trouble. And we\u2019ve had our meat.\u201d\n\nThere was a blink of bright light beyond the forest and the thunder exploded again so that a littlun started to whine. Big drops of rain fell among them making individual sounds when they struck.\n\n\u201cGoing to be a storm,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cand you\u2019ll have rain like when we dropped here. Who\u2019s clever now? Where are your shelters? What are you going to do about that?\u201d\n\nThe hunters were looking uneasily at the sky, flinching from the stroke of the drops. A wave of restlessness set the boys swaying and moving aimlessly. The flickering light became brighter and the blows of the thunder were only just bearable. The littluns began to run about, screaming.\n\nJack leapt on to the sand.\n\u201cDo our dance! Come on! Dance!\u201d\n\nHe ran stumbling through the thick sand to the open space of rock beyond the fire. Between the flashes of lightning the air was dark and terrible; and the boys followed him, clamorously. Roger became the pig, grunting and charging at Jack, who side-stepped. The hunters took their spears, the cooks took spits, and the rest clubs of firewood. A circling movement developed and a chant. While Roger mimed the terror of the\npig, the littluns ran and jumped on the outside of the circle. Piggy and Ralph, under the threat of the sky, found themselves eager to take a place in this demented but partly secure society. They were glad to touch the brown backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable.\n\n\u201cKill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\u201d\n\nThe movement became regular while the chant lost its first superficial excitement and began to beat like a steady pulse. Roger ceased to be a pig and became a hunter, so that the center of the ring yawned emptily. Some of the littluns started a ring on their own; and the complementary circles went round and round as though repetition would achieve safety\nof itself. There was the throb and stamp of a single organism.\nThe dark sky was shattered by a blue-white scar. An instant later the noise was on them like the blow of a gigantic whip. The chant rose a tone in agony.\n\n\u201cKill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\u201d\n\nNow out of the terror rose another desire, thick, urgent, blind.\n\u201cKill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\u201d\n\nAgain the blue-white scar jagged above them and the sulphurous explosion beat down. The littluns screamed and blundered about, fleeing from the edge of the forest, and one of them broke the ring of biguns in his terror.\n\u201cHim! Him!\u201d\nThe circle became a horseshoe. A thing was crawling out of the forest.\n\nIt came darkly, uncertainly. The shrill screaming that rose before the beast was like a pain. The beast stumbled into the horseshoe.\n\n\u201cKill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\u201d\n\nThe blue-white scar was constant, the noise unendurable. Simon was crying out something about a dead man on a hill.\n\n\u201cKill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood! Do him in!\u201d\nThe sticks fell and the mouth of the new circle crunched and screamed. The beast was on its knees in the center, its arms folded over its face. It was crying out against the abominable noise something about a body on the hill. The beast struggled forward, broke the ring and fell over the steep edge of the rock to the sand by the water. At once the crowd surged after it, poured down the rock, leapt on to the beast, screamed, struck,\nbit, tore. There were no words, and no movements but the tearing of teeth and claws. Then the clouds opened and let down the rain like a waterfall. The water bounded from the mountain-top, tore leaves and branches from the trees, poured like a cold shower over the struggling heap on the sand.\n\nPresently the heap broke up and figures staggered away. Only the beast lay still, a few yards from the sea. Even in the rain they could see how small a beast it was; and already its blood was staining the sand. Now a great wind blew the rain sideways, cascading the water from the forest trees. On the mountain-top the parachute filled and moved; the figure slid, rose to its feet, spun, swayed down through a vastness of\nwet air and trod with ungainly feet the tops of the high trees; falling, still falling, it sank toward the beach and the boys rushed screaming into the darkness. The parachute took the figure forward, furrowing the lagoon, and bumped it over the reef and out to sea. Towards midnight the rain ceased and the clouds drifted away, so that the sky was scattered once more with the incredible lamps of stars. Then the breeze died too and there was no noise save the drip and trickle of water that ran out of clefts and spilled down, leaf by leaf, to the brown\nearth of the island. The air was cool, moist, and clear; and presently even the sound of the water was still. The beast lay huddled on the pale beach and the stains spread, inch by inch.\nThe edge of the lagoon became a streak of phosphorescence which advanced minutely, as the great wave of the tide flowed. The clear water mirrored the clear sky and the angular bright constellations. The line of phosphorescence bulged about the sand grains and little pebbles; it held them each in a dimple of tension, then suddenly accepted them with an\ninaudible syllable and moved on.\n\nAlong the shoreward edge of the shallows the advancing clearness was full of strange, moonbeam-bodied creatures with fiery eyes. Here and there a larger pebble clung to its own air and was covered with a coat of pearls. The tide swelled in over the rain-pitted sand and smoothed everything with a layer of silver. Now it touched the first of the stains that seeped from the broken body and the creatures made a moving patch of light as they gathered at the edge. The water rose farther and dressed Simon\u2019s coarse hair with brightness. The line of his cheek silvered and the turn of his shoulder became sculptured marble. The strange attendant creatures, with their fiery eyes and trailing vapors, busied themselves\nround his head. The body lifted a fraction of an inch from the sand and a bubble of air escaped from the mouth with a wet plop. Then it turned gently in the water. Somewhere over the darkened curve of the world the sun and moon were pulling, and the film of water on the earth planet was held, bulging\nslightly on one side while the solid core turned. The great wave of the tide moved farther along the island and the water lifted. Softly, surrounded by a fringe of inquisitive bright creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations, Simon\u2019s dead body moved out toward the open\nsea.",fe="Piggy eyed the advancing figure carefully. Nowadays he sometimes found that he saw more clearly if he removed his glasses and shifted the one lens to the other eye; but even through the good eye, after what had happened, Ralph remained unmistakably Ralph. He came now out of the coconut trees, limping, dirty, with dead leaves hanging from his shock of yellow hair. One eye was a slit in his puffy cheek and a great scab had formed on his right knee. He paused for a moment and peered at the figure on the platform.\n\n\u201cPiggy? Are you the only one left?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some littluns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t count. No biguns?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2014Samneric. They\u2019re collecting wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\n\nRalph climbed on to the platform carefully. The coarse grass was still worn away where the assembly used to sit; the fragile white conch still gleamed by the polished seat. Ralph sat down in the grass facing the chief\u2019s seat and the conch. Piggy knelt at his left, and for a long minute there was silence.\n\nAt last Ralph cleared his throat and whispered something.\n\nPiggy whispered back.\n\n\u201cWhat you say?\u201d\n\nRalph spoke up.\n\n\u201cSimon.\u201d\n\nPiggy said nothing but nodded, solemnly. They continued to sit, gazing with impaired sight at the chief\u2019s seat and the glittering lagoon. The green light and the glossy patches of sunshine played over their befouled bodies.\n\nAt length Ralph got up and went to the conch. He took the shell caressingly with both hands and knelt, leaning against the trunk.\n\n\u201cPiggy.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we going to do?\u201d\n\nPiggy nodded at the conch.\n\n\u201cYou could\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCall an assembly?\u201d\n\nRalph laughed sharply as he said the word and Piggy frowned.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still chief.\u201d\n\nRalph laughed again.\n\n\u201cYou are. Over us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the conch.\u201d\n\n\u201cRalph! Stop laughing like that. Look, there ain\u2019t no need, Ralph!\n\nWhat\u2019s the others going to think?\u201d\n\nAt last Ralph stopped. He was shivering.\n\n\u201cPiggy.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was Simon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said that before.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiggy.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stop it!\u201d said Piggy, shrilly. \u201cWhat good\u2019re you doing talking like that?\u201d\n\nHe jumped to his feet and stood over Ralph.\n\n\u201cIt was dark. There was that\u2014that bloody dance. There was lightning and thunder and rain. We was scared!\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t scared,\u201d said Ralph slowly, \u201cI was\u2014I don\u2019t know what I was.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe was scared!\u201d said Piggy excitedly. \u201cAnything might have happened.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2014what you said.\u201d\n\nHe was gesticulating, searching for a formula.\n\n\u201cOh, Piggy!\u201d\n\nRalph\u2019s voice, low and stricken, stopped Piggy\u2019s gestures. He bent down and waited. Ralph, cradling the conch, rocked himself to and fro.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you understand, Piggy? The things we did\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe may still be\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cP\u2019raps he was only pretending\u2014\u201d\n\nPiggy\u2019s voice trailed off at the sight of Ralph\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cYou were outside. Outside the circle. You never really came in. Didn\u2019t\n\nyou see what we\u2014what they did?\u201d\n\nThere was loathing, and at the same time a kind of feverish excitement, in his voice.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you see, Piggy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all that well. I only got one eye now. You ought to know that,\n\nRalph.\u201d\n\nRalph continued to rock to and fro.\n\n\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d said Piggy suddenly, \u201cthat\u2019s what it was. An accident.\u201d His voice shrilled again. \u201cComing in the dark\u2014he hadn\u2019t no business crawling like that out of the dark. He was batty. He asked for it.\u201d He gesticulated widely again. \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see what they did\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Ralph. We got to forget this. We can\u2019t do no good thinking about it, see?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frightened. Of us. I want to go home. Oh God, I want to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d said Piggy stubbornly, \u201cand that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\nHe touched Ralph\u2019s bare shoulder and Ralph shuddered at the human contact.\n\n\u201cAnd look, Ralph\u201d\u2014Piggy glanced round quickly, then leaned close\u2014\n\n\u201cdon\u2019t let on we was in that dance. Not to Samneric.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we were! All of us!\u201d\n\nPiggy shook his head.\n\n\u201cNot us till last. They never noticed in the dark. Anyway you said I was only on the outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo was I,\u201d muttered Ralph, \u201cI was on the outside too.\u201d\n\nPiggy nodded eagerly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. We was on the outside. We never done nothing, we never seen nothing.\u201d\n\nPiggy paused, then went on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll live on our own, the four of us\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFour of us. We aren\u2019t enough to keep the fire burning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try. See? I lit it.\u201d\n\nSamneric came dragging a great log out of the forest. They dumped it by the fire and turned to the pool. Ralph jumped to his feet.\n\n\u201cHi! You two!\u201d\n\nThe twins checked a moment, then walked on.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to bathe, Ralph.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter get it over.\u201d\n\nThe twins were very surprised to see Ralph. They flushed and looked past him into the air.\n\n\u201cHullo. Fancy meeting you, Ralph.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just been in the forest\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014to get wood for the fire\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014we got lost last night.\u201d\n\nRalph examined his toes.\n\n\u201cYou got lost after the. . . \u201d\n\nPiggy cleaned his lens.\n\n\u201cAfter the feast,\u201d said Sam in a stifled voice. Eric nodded. \u201cYes, after the feast.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe left early,\u201d said Piggy quickly, \u201cbecause we were tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did we\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014very early\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014we were very tired.\u201d\n\nSam touched a scratch on his forehead and then hurriedly took his hand away. Eric fingered his split lip.\n\n\u201cYes. We were very tired,\u201d repeated Sam, \u201cso we left early. Was it a good\u2014\u201d\n\nThe air was heavy with unspoken knowledge. Sam twisted and the obscene word shot out of him. \u201c\u2014dance?\u201d\n\nMemory of the dance that none of them had attended shook all four boys convulsively.\n\n\u201cWe left early.\u201d\n\nWhen Roger came to the neck of land that joined the Castle Rock to the mainland he was not surprised to be challenged. He had reckoned, during the terrible night, on finding at least some of the tribe holding out against the horrors of the island in the safest place.\n\nThe voice rang out sharply from on high, where the diminishing crags were balanced one on another.\n\n\u201cHalt! Who goes there?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoger.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdvance, friend.\u201d\n\nRoger advanced.\n\n\u201cYou could see who I was.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chief said we got to challenge everyone.\u201d\n\nRoger peered up.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t stop me coming if I wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t I? Climb up and see.\u201d\n\nRoger clambered up the ladder-like cliff.\n\n\u201cLook at this.\u201d\n\nA log had been jammed under the topmost rock and another lever un-\nder that. Robert leaned lightly on the lever and the rock groaned. A full effort would send the rock thundering down to the neck of land. Roger admired.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a proper chief, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nRobert nodded.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to take us hunting.\u201d\n\nHe jerked his head in the direction of the distant shelters where a thread of white smoke climbed up the sky. Roger, sitting on the very edge of the cliff, looked somberly back at the island as he worked with his fingers at a loose tooth. His gaze settled on the top of the distant mountain and Robert changed the unspoken subject.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to beat Wilfred.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\nRobert shook his head doubtfully.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t say. He got angry and made us tie Wilfred up.\n\nHe\u2019s been\u201d\u2014he giggled excitedly\u2014\u201che\u2019s been tied for hours, waiting\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t the chief say why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard him.\u201d\n\nSitting on the tremendous rock in the torrid sun, Roger received this news as an illumination. He ceased to work at his tooth and sat still, assimilating the possibilities of irresponsible authority. Then, without another word, he climbed down the back of the rocks toward the cave and the rest of the tribe.\n\nThe chief was sitting there, naked to the waist, his face blocked out in white and red. The tribe lay in a semicircle before him. The newly beaten and untied Wilfred was sniffing noisily in the background. Roger squatted with the rest.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d went on the chief, \u201cwe shall hunt again.\u201d\n\nHe pointed at this savage and that with his spear.\n\n\u201cSome of you will stay here to improve the cave and defend the gate. I shall take a few hunters with me and bring back meat. The defenders of the gate will see that the others don\u2019t sneak in.\u201d\n\nA savage raised his hand and the chief turned a bleak, painted face toward him.\n\n\u201cWhy should they try to sneak in, Chief?\u201d\n\nThe chief was vague but earnest.\n\n\u201cThey will. They\u2019ll try to spoil things we do. So the watchers at thegate must be careful. And then\u2014\u201d\n\nThe chief paused. They saw a triangle of startling pink dart out, pass along his lips and vanish again.\n\n\u201c\u2014and then, the beast might try to come in. You remember how he\n\ncrawled\u2014\u201d\n\nThe semicircle shuddered and muttered in agreement.\n\n\u201cHe came\u2014disguised. He may come again even though we gave him the head of our kill to eat. So watch; and be careful.\u201d\n\nStanley lifted his forearm off the rock and held up an interrogative finger.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t we, didn\u2019t we\u2014?\u201d\n\nHe squirmed and looked down.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\nIn the silence that followed, each savage flinched away from his individual memory.\n\n\u201cNo! How could we\u2014kill\u2014it?\u201d\n\nHalf-relieved, half-daunted by the implication of further terrors, the savages murmured again.\n\n\u201cSo leave the mountain alone,\u201d said the chief, solemnly, \u201cand give it the head if you go hunting.\u201d\n\nStanley flicked his finger again.\n\n\u201cI expect the beast disguised itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said the chief. A theological speculation presented itself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better keep on the right side of him, anyhow. You can\u2019t tell what he might do.\u201d\n\nThe tribe considered this; and then were shaken, as if by a flow of wind. The chief saw the effect of his words and stood abruptly.\n\n\u201cBut tomorrow we\u2019ll hunt and when we\u2019ve got meat we\u2019ll have a feast\u2014\u201d\n\nBill put up his hand.\n\n\u201cChief.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll we use for lighting the fire?\u201d\n\nThe chief\u2019s blush was hidden by the white and red clay. Into his un-\ncertain silence the tribe spilled their murmur once more. Then the chief held up his hand.\n\n\u201cWe shall take fire from the others. Listen. Tomorrow we\u2019ll hunt and get meat. Tonight I\u2019ll go along with two hunters\u2014who\u2019ll come?\u201d\n\nMaurice and Roger put up their hands.\n\n\u201cMaurice\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Chief?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere was their fire?\u201d\n\n\u201cBack at the old place by the fire rock.\u201d\n\nThe chief nodded.\n\n\u201cThe rest of you can go to sleep as soon as the sun sets. But us three, Maurice, Roger and me, we\u2019ve got work to do. We\u2019ll leave just before sunset\u2014\u201d\n\nMaurice put up his hand.\n\n\u201cBut what happens if we meet\u2014\u201d\n\nThe chief waved his objection aside.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep along by the sands. Then if he comes we\u2019ll do our, our dance again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly the three of us?\u201d\n\nAgain the murmur swelled and died away.\n\nPiggy handed Ralph his glasses and waited to receive back his sight.\n\nThe wood was damp; and this was the third time they had lighted it.\n\nRalph stood back, speaking to himself.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want another night without fire.\u201d\n\nHe looked round guiltily at the three boys standing by. This was the first time he had admitted the double function of the fire. Certainly one was to send up a beckoning column of smoke; but the other was to be a hearth now and a comfort until they slept. Eric breathed on the wood till it glowed and sent out a little flame. A billow of white and yellow smoke reeked up. Piggy took back his glasses and looked at the smoke with pleasure.\n\n\u201cIf only we could make a radio!\u201d\n\n\u201cOr a plane\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014or a boat.\u201d\n\nRalph dredged in his fading knowledge of the world.\n\n\u201cWe might get taken prisoner by the Reds.\u201d\n\nEric pushed back his hair.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d be better than\u2014\u201d\n\nHe would not name people and Sam finished the sentence for him by nodding along the beach.\nRalph remembered the ungainly figure on a parachute.\n\n\u201cHe said something about a dead man.\u201d He flushed painfully at this admission that he had been present at the dance. He made urging motions at the smoke and with his body. \u201cDon\u2019t stop\u2014go on up!\u201d\n\n\u201cSmoke\u2019s getting thinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more wood already, even when it\u2019s wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy asthma\u2014\u201d\n\nThe response was mechanical.\n\n\u201cSucks to your ass-mar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I pull logs, I get my asthma bad. I wish I didn\u2019t, Ralph, but there it is.\u201d\n\nThe three boys went into the forest and fetched armfuls of rotten wood.\n\nOnce more the smoke rose, yellow and thick.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat.\u201d\n\nTogether they went to the fruit trees, carrying their spears, saying little, cramming in haste. When they came out of the forest again the sun was setting and only embers glowed in the fire, and there was no smoke.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t carry any more wood,\u201d said Eric. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\nRalph cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cWe kept the fire going up there.\u201d\n\n\u201cUp there it was small. But this has got to be a big one.\u201d\n\nRalph carried a fragment to the fire and watched the smoke that drifted into the dusk.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep it going.\u201d\n\nEric flung himself down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too tired. And what\u2019s the good?\u201d\n\n\u201cEric!\u201d cried Ralph in a shocked voice. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that!\u201d\n\nSam knelt by Eric.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014what is the good?\u201d\n\nRalph tried indignantly to remember. There was something good about a fire. Something overwhelmingly good.\n\n\u201cRalph\u2019s told you often enough,\u201d said Piggy moodily. \u201cHow else are we going to be rescued?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! If we don\u2019t make smoke\u2014\u201d\n\nHe squatted before them in the crowding dusk.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you understand? What\u2019s the good of wishing for radios and boats?\u201d\n\nHe held out his hand and twisted the fingers into a fist.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing we can do to get out of this mess. Anyone can play at hunting, anyone can get us meat\u2014\u201d\n\nHe looked from face to face. Then, at the moment of greatest passion and conviction, that curtain flapped in his head and he forgot what he had been driving at. He knelt there, his fist clenched, gazing solemnly from one to the other. Then the curtain whisked back.\n\n\u201cOh, yes. So we\u2019ve got to make smoke; and more smoke\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t keep it going! Look at that!\u201d\n\nThe fire was dying on them.\n\n\u201cTwo to mind the fire,\u201d said Ralph, half to himself, \u201cthat\u2019s twelve hours\n\na day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get any more wood, Ralph\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014not in the dark\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014not at night\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can light it every morning,\u201d said Piggy. \u201cNobody ain\u2019t going to see\n\nsmoke in the dark.\u201d\n\nSam nodded vigorously.\n\n\u201cIt was different when the fire was\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014up there.\u201d\n\nRalph stood up, feeling curiously defenseless with the darkness press-\ning in.\n\n\u201cLet the fire go then, for tonight.\u201d\n\nHe led the way to the first shelter, which still stood, though battered.\n\nThe bed leaves lay within, dry and noisy to the touch. In the next shelter a littlun was talking in his sleep. The four biguns crept into the shelter and burrowed under the leaves. The twins lay together and Ralph and Piggy at the other end. For a while there was the continual creak and rustle of leaves as they tried for comfort.\n\n\u201cPiggy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose so.\u201d\n\nAt length, save for an occasional rustle, the shelter was silent. An ob-long of blackness relieved with brilliant spangles hung before them and there was the hollow sound of surf on the reef. Ralph settled himself for his nightly game of supposing. . .\nSupposing they could be transported home by jet, then before morning they would land at that big airfield in Wiltshire. They would go by car; no, for things to be perfect they would go by train; all the way down to Devon and take that cottage again. Then at the foot of the garden the wild ponies would come and look over the wall. . . . Ralph turned restlessly in the leaves. Dartmoor was wild and so were the ponies. But the attraction of wildness had gone. His mind skated to a consideration of a tamed town where savagery could not set foot. What could be safer than the bus center with its lamps and wheels? All at once, Ralph was dancing round a lamp standard. There was a bus crawling out of the bus station, a strange bus. . . .\n\n\u201cRalph! Ralph!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a noise like that\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\nFrom the darkness of the further end of the shelter came a dreadful moaning and they shattered the leaves in their fear. Sam and Eric, locked in an embrace, were fighting each other.\n\n\u201cSam! Sam!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey\u2014Eric!\u201d\n\nPresently all was quiet again.\n\nPiggy spoke softly to Ralph.\n\n\u201cWe got to get out of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet rescued.\u201d\n\nFor the first time that day, and despite the crowding blackness, Ralph sniggered.\n\n\u201cI mean it,\u201d whispered Piggy. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get home soon we\u2019ll be barmy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRound the bend.\u201d\n\n\u201cBomb happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrackers.\u201d\n\nRalph pushed the damp tendrils of hair out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou write a letter to your auntie.\u201d\n\nPiggy considered this solemnly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where she is now. And I haven\u2019t got an envelope and a stamp. An\u2019 there isn\u2019t a mailbox. Or a postman.\u201d\n\nThe success of his tiny joke overcame Ralph. His sniggers became un-controllable, his body jumped and twitched.\n\nPiggy rebuked him with dignity.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything all that funny.\u201d\n\nRalph continued to snigger though his chest hurt. His twitchings exhausted him till he lay, breathless and woebegone, waiting for the next spasm. During one of these pauses he was ambushed by sleep.\n\n\u201cRalph! You been making a noise again. Do be quiet, Ralph\u2014because.\u201d\n\nRalph heaved over among the leaves. He had reason to be thankful that his dream was broken, for the bus had been nearer and more distinct.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014because?\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet\u2014and listen.\u201d\n\nRalph lay down carefully, to the accompaniment of a long sigh from the leaves. Eric moaned something and then lay still. The darkness, save for the useless oblong of stars, was blanket-thick.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something moving outside.\u201d\n\nRalph\u2019s head prickled. The sound of his blood drowned all else and then subsided.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t hear anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen. Listen for a long time.\u201d\n\nQuite clearly and emphatically, and only a yard or so away from the back of the shelter, a stick cracked. The blood roared again in Ralph\u2019s ears, confused images chased each other through his mind. A composite of these things was prowling round the shelters. He could feel Piggy\u2019s head against his shoulder and the convulsive grip of a hand.\n\n\u201cRalph! Ralph!\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up and listen.\u201d\n\nDesperately, Ralph prayed that the beast would prefer littluns.\n\nA voice whispered horribly outside.\n\n\u201cPiggy\u2014Piggy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come!\u201d gasped Piggy. \u201cIt\u2019s real!\u201d\n\nHe clung to Ralph and reached to get his breath.\n\n\u201cPiggy, come outside. I want you, Piggy.\u201d\n\nRalph\u2019s mouth was against Piggy\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiggy\u2014where are you, Piggy?\u201d\n\nSomething brushed against the back of the shelter. Piggy kept still for a moment, then he had his asthma. He arched his back and crashed among the leaves with his legs. Ralph rolled away from him. Then there was a vicious snarling in the mouth of the shelter and the plunge and thump of living things. Someone tripped over Ralph and Piggy\u2019s corner became a complication of snarls and crashes and flying limbs. Ralph hit out; then he and what seemed like a dozen others were rolling over and over, hitting, biting, scratching. He was torn and jolted, found fingers in his mouth and bit them. A fist withdrew and came back like a piston, so that the whole shelter exploded into light. Ralph twisted sideways on top of a writhing body and felt hot breath on his cheek. He began to pound the mouth below him, using his clenched fist as a ham-\nmer; he hit with more and more passionate hysteria as the face became slippery. A knee jerked up between his legs and he fell sideways, busying himself with his pain, and the fight rolled over him. Then the shelter collapsed with smothering finality; and the anonymous shapes fought their way out and through. Dark figures drew themselves out of the wreckage and flitted away, till the screams of the littluns and Piggy\u2019s gasps were once more audible.\n\nRalph called out in a quavering voice.\n\n\u201cAll you littluns, go to sleep. We\u2019ve had a fight with the others. Now go to sleep.\u201d\n\nSamneric came close and peered at Ralph.\n\n\u201cAre you two all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014I got busted.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did I. How\u2019s Piggy?\u201d\n\nThey hauled Piggy clear of the wreckage and leaned him against a tree.\n\nThe night was cool and purged of immediate terror. Piggy\u2019s breathing was a little easier.\n\n\u201cDid you get hurt, Piggy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was Jack and his hunters,\u201d said Ralph bitterly. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they leave us alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gave them something to think about,\u201d said Sam. Honesty compelled him to go on. \u201cAt least you did. I got mixed up with myself in a corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave one of \u2019em what for,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cI smashed him up all right.\n\nHe won\u2019t want to come and fight us again in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d said Eric. \u201cWhen I woke up one was kicking me in the face.\n\nI got an awful bloody face, I think, Ralph. But I did him in the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI got my knee up,\u201d said Eric with simple pride, \u201cand I hit him with it in the pills. You should have heard him holler! He won\u2019t come back in a hurry either. So we didn\u2019t do too badly.\u201d\n\nRalph moved suddenly in the dark; but then he heard Eric working his mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 a tooth loose.\u201d\n\nPiggy drew up his legs.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Piggy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought they wanted the conch.\u201d\n\nRalph trotted down the pale beach and jumped on to the platform. The conch still glimmered by the chief\u2019s seat. He gazed for a moment or two, then went back to Piggy.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t take the conch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. They didn\u2019t come for the conch. They came for something else. Ralph\u2014what am I going to do?\u201d\n\nFar off along the bowstave of beach, three figures trotted toward the Castle Rock. They kept away from the forest and down by the water.\n\nOccasionally they sang softly; occasionally they turned cartwheels down by the moving streak of phosphorescence. The chief led then, trotting steadily, exulting in his achievement. He was a chief now in truth; and he made stabbing motions with his spear. From his left hand dangled Piggy\u2019s broken glasses.",me='IN THE short chill of dawn the four boys gathered round the black smudge where the fire had been, while Ralph kneeled and blew. Grey, feathery ashes quickly ran here and there at his breath but no spark shone among them. The twins watched nervously and Piggy sat blank behind the glowing wall of his (unable to see far things clearly). Ralph continued to blow till his ears were singing with the effort, but then the first breeze of dawn took the job off his hands and blinded him with ashes. He squatted back, swore, and rubbed water out of his eyes.\n\n"No use."\n\nErick looked down at him through a mask of dried blood. Piggy stared in the general direction of Ralph.\n\n" \'Course it\'s no use, Ralph. Now we got no fire."\n\nRalph brought his face within a couple of feet of Piggy\'s.\n\n"Can you see me?"\n\n"A bit."\n\nRalph allowed the swollen flap of his cheek to close his eye again.\n\n"They\'ve got our fire."\n\nExtreme anger screamed his voice.\n\n"They stole it!"\n\n"That\'s them," said Piggy. "They blinded me. See? That\'s Jack Merridew. You call a (group of people/device made up of smaller parts), Ralph, we got to decide what to do."\n\n"A (group of people/device made up of smaller parts) for only us?"\n\n160\n\n"It\'s all we got. Sam--let me hold on to you."\n\nThey went toward the (raised, flat supporting surface).\n\n"Blow the conch," said Piggy. "Blow as loud as you can."\n\nThe forests re-echoed; and birds lifted, crying out of the treetops, as on that first morning many years ago. Both ways the beach was (having no people). Some littluns came from the shelters. Ralph sat down on the polished trunk and the three others stood before him. He nodded, and Samneric sat down on the right. Ralph pushed the conch into Piggy\'s hands. He held the shining thing carefully and blinked at Ralph.\n\n"Go on, then."\n\n"I just take the conch to say this. I can\'t see no more and I got to get my glasses back. Awful things has been done on this island. I voted for you for chief. He\'s the only one who ever got anything done. So now you speak, Ralph, and tell us what. Or else--"\n\nPiggy broke off, crying and complaining. Ralph took back the conch as he sat down.\n\n"Just an ordinary fire. You\'d think we could do that, wouldn\'t you? Just a smoke signal so we can be rescued. Are we violently injures or what? Only now there\'s no signal going up. Ships may be passing. Do you remember how he went hunting and the fire went out and a ship passed by? And they all think he\'s best as chief. Then there was, there was . . . that\'s his fault, too. If it hadn\'t been for him it would never have happened. Now Piggy can\'t see, and they came, stealing"--Ralph\'s voice ran up--"at night, in darkness, and stole our fire. They stole it. We\'d have given them fire if they\'d asked. But they stole it and the signal\'s out and we can\'t ever be rescued. Don\'t you see what I mean? We\'d have given them fire for themselves only they stole it. I--"\n\nHe paused lamely as the curtain flickered in his brain. Piggy held out his hands for the conch.\n\n"What you goin\' to do, Ralph? This is jus\' talk without deciding. I want my glasses."\n\n"I\'m trying to think. Supposing we go, looking like we used to, washed and hair brushed--after all we aren\'t violent people really and being rescued isn\'t a game--"\n\nHe opened the flap of his cheek and looked at the twins.\n\n"We could smarten up a bit and then go--"\n\n"We should take spears," said Sam. "Even Piggy."\n\n"--because we may need them."\n\n161\n\n"You haven\'t got the conch!"\n\nPiggy held up the shell.\n\n"You can take spears if you want but I shan\'t. What\'s the good? I\'ll have to be led like a dog, anyhow. Yes, laugh. Go on, laugh. There\'s them on this island as would laugh at anything. And what happened? What\'s grownups goin\' to think? Young Simon was murdered. And there was that other kid what had a mark on his face. Who\'s seen him since we first come here?"\n\n"Piggy! Stop a minute!"\n\n"I got the conch. I\'m going to that Jack Merridew an\' tell him, I am."\n\n"You\'ll get hurt."\n\n"What can he do more than he has? I\'ll tell him what\'s what. You let me carry the conch, Ralph. I\'ll show him the one thing he hasn\'t got."\n\nPiggy paused for a moment and stared round at the dim figures. The shape of the old (group of people/device made up of smaller parts), walked in the grass, listened to him.\n\n"I\'m going to him with this conch in my hands. I\'m going to hold it out. Look, I\'m goin\' to say, you\'re stronger than I am and you haven\'t got breathing disease. You can see, I\'m goin\' to say, and with both eyes. But I don\'t ask for my glasses back, not as a favor. I don\'t ask you to be a sport, I\'ll say, not because you\'re strong, but because what\'s right\'s right. Give me my glasses, I\'m going to say--you got to!"\n\nPiggy ended, flushed and shaking (with fear or emotion). He pushed the conch quickly into Ralph\'s hands like in a hurry to be rid of it and wiped the tears from his eyes. The green light was gentle about them and the conch lay at Ralph\'s feet, delicate and breakable and white. A single drop of water that had escaped Piggy\'s fingers now flashed on the delicate curve like a star.\n\nAt last Ralph sat up straight and drew back his hair.\n\n"All right. I mean--you can try if you like. We\'ll go with you."\n\n"He\'ll be painted," said Sam, shyly. "You know how he\'ll be--"\n\n"--he won\'t think much of us--"\n\n"--if he gets waxy we\'ve had it--"\n\nRalph frowned at Sam. Dimly he remembered something Simon had said to him once, by the rocks.\n\n"Don\'t be silly," he said. And then he added quickly, "Let\'s go."\n\nHe held out the conch to Piggy who reddish-pink, this time with pride.\n\n162\n\n"You must carry it."\n\n"When we\'re ready I\'ll carry it--"\n\nPiggy searched for/tried to get in his mind for words to bring across his emotional (in a good way) (state of mind where someone will definitely do something if needed) to carry the conch against all odds.\n\n"I don\'t mind. I\'ll be glad, Ralph, only I\'ll have to be led."\n\nRalph put the conch back on the shining log.\n\n"We better eat and then get ready."\n\nThey made their way to the destroyed fruit trees. Piggy was helped to his food and found some by touch. While they ate, Ralph thought of the afternoon.\n\n"We\'ll be like we were. We\'ll wash--"\n\nSam gulped down a mouthful and protested.\n\n"But we wash every day!"\n\nRalph looked at the very dirty objects before him and sighed.\n\n"We should comb our hair. Only it\'s too long."\n\n"I\'ve got both socks left in the shelter," said Eric, "so we could pull them over our heads like caps, sort of."\n\n"We could find some stuff," said Piggy, "and tie your hair back."\n\n"Like a girl!"\n\n"No. \'Course not."\n\n"Then we must go as we are," said Ralph, "and they won\'t be any better."\n\nEric made a detaining (hand/arm movement)/action.\n\n"But they\'ll be painted! You know how it is."\n\nThe others nodded. They understood only too well the freeing/freedom into (violent, animal-like behavior) that the hiding paint brought.\n\n"Well, we won\'t be painted," said Ralph, "because we aren\'t violent people."\n\nSamneric looked at each other.\n\n"All the same--"\n\nRalph shouted.\n\n"No paint!"\n\nHe tried to remember.\n\n"Smoke," he said, "we want smoke."\n\nHe turned on the twins extremely strongly.\n\n"I said \'smoke\'! We\'ve got to have smoke."\n\nThere was silence, except for the (many people or things) whisper of the bees. As last Piggy spoke, kind/nicely.\n\n163\n\n"\'Course we have. \'Cos the smoke\'s a signal and we can\'t be rescued if we don\'t have smoke."\n\n"I knew that!" shouted Ralph. He pulled his arm away from Piggy. "Are you suggesting--?"\n\n"I\'m jus\' saying what you always say," said Piggy quickly. "I\'d thought for a moment--"\n\n"I hadn\'t," said Ralph loudly. "I knew it all the time. I hadn\'t forgotten."\n\nPiggy nodded calmingly.\n\n"You\'re chief, Ralph. You remember everything."\n\n"I hadn\'t forgotten."\n\n" \'Course not."\n\nThe twins were examining Ralph curiously, like they were seeing him for the first time.\n\nThey set off along the beach (in neat rows or groups). Ralph went first, limping a little, his spear carried over one shoulder. He saw things partially, through the shake (with fear or emotion) of the heat haze over the flashing sands, and his own long hair and injuries. Behind him came the twins, worried now for a while but full of impossible-to-satisfy energy. They said little but trailed the butts of their wooden spears; for Piggy had found that, by looking down and shielding his tired sight from the sun, he could just see these moving along the sand. He walked between the trailing butts, therefore, the conch held carefully between his two hands. The boys made a compact little group that moved over the beach, four plate-like shadows dancing and mixing beneath them. There was no sign left of the storm, and the beach was swept clean like a blade that has been scrubbed/inspected. The sky and the mountain were at a huge distance, shimmering in the heat; and the reef was lifted by mirage, floating in a kind of silver pool halfway up the sky.\n\nThey passed the place where the tribe had danced. The blackened (by fire) sticks still lay on the rocks where the rain had satisfied them but the sand by the water was smooth again. They passed this in silence. No one doubted that the tribe would be found at the Castle Rock and when they came in sight of it they stopped with one agreement/peace. The densest tangle on the island, a mass of twisted stems, black and green and (unable to be understood or broken through), lay on their left and tall grass swayed before them. Now Ralph went forward.\n\n164\n\nHere was the crushed grass where they had all lain when he had gone to prospect. There was the neck of land, the ledge (avoiding/going around the edge of) the rock, up there were the red peaks.\n\nSam touched his arm.\n\n"Smoke."\n\nThere was a tiny smudge of smoke shifting back and forth into the air on the other side of the rock.\n\n"Some fire--I don\'t think."\n\nRalph turned.\n\n"What are we hiding for?"\n\nHe stepped through the screen of grass on to the little open space that led to the narrow neck.\n\n"You two follow behind. I\'ll go first, then Piggy a pace behind me. Keep your spears ready."\n\nPiggy stared nervously into the glowing cover that hung between him and the world.\n\n"Is it safe? Ain\'t there a cliff? I can hear the sea."\n\n"You keep right close to me."\n\nRalph moved forward on to the neck. He kicked a stone and it bounded into the water. Then the sea sucked down, showing/telling about a red, weedy square forty feet beneath Ralph\'s left arm.\n\n"Am I safe?" quavered Piggy. "I feel awful--"\n\nHigh above them from the peaks came a sudden shout and then a fake war-cry that was answered by twelve voices from behind the rock.\n\n"Give me the conch and stay still."\n\n"Halt! Who goes there?"\n\nRalph bent back his head and seen/looked Roger\'s dark face at the top.\n\n"You can see who I am!" he shouted. "Stop being silly!"\n\nHe put the conch to his lips and began to blow. Violent people appeared, painted out of recognition, edging round the ledge toward the neck. They carried spears and disposed themselves to defend the entrance. Ralph went on blowing and ignored Piggy\'s terrors.\n\nRoger was shouting.\n\n"You mind out--see?"\n\nEventually Ralph took his lips away and paused to get his breath back. His first words were a (sudden, short breath in), but able to be heard.\n\n165\n\n"--calling a (group of people/device made up of smaller parts)."\n\nThe violent people guarding the neck mumbled among themselves but made no movement. Ralph walked forwards a couple of steps. A voice whispered very badly behind him.\n\n"Don\'t leave me, Ralph."\n\n"You kneel down," said Ralph sideways, "and wait till I come back."\n\nHe stood halfway along the neck and looked at the violent people intently. Freed by the paint, they had tied their hair back and were more comfortable than he was. Ralph made a promise/solution to tie his own back later/after that. In fact he felt like telling them to wait and doing it there and then; but that was impossible. The violent people giggled a bit and one moved/acted at Ralph with his spear. High above, Roger took his hands off the lever and leaned out to see what was going on. The boys on the neck stood in a pool of their own shadow, reduced to shaggy heads. Piggy bent down, his back shapeless as a sack.\n\n"I\'m calling a (group of people/device made up of smaller parts)."\n\nSilence.\n\nRoger took up a small stone and threw/thrown it between the twins, aiming to miss. They started and Sam only just kept his footing. Some source of power began to pulse in Roger\'s body.\n\nRalph spoke again, loudly.\n\n"I\'m calling a (group of people/device made up of smaller parts)."\n\nHe ran his eye over them.\n\n"Where\'s Jack?"\n\nThe group of boys stirred and talked to. A painted face spoke with the voice of Robert.\n\n"He\'s hunting. And he said we weren\'t to let you in."\n\n"I\'ve come to see about the fire," said Ralph, "and about Piggy\'s specs."\n\nThe group in front of him shifted and laughter shook (from fear or cold) outwards from among them, light, excited laughter that went echoing among the tall rocks.\n\nA voice spoke from behind Ralph.\n\n"What do you want?"\n\nThe twins made a bolt past Ralph and got between him and the entry. He turned quickly. Jack, (able to be seen or picked out) by personality and red hair, was advancing from the forest. A hunter bent down on either side. All\n\n166\n\nthree were hid/hidden in black and green. Behind them on the grass the headless and big stomached body of a female pig lay where they had dropped it.\n\nPiggy loudly cried.\n\n"Ralph! Don\'t leave me!"\n\nWith completely ridiculous care he supported the rock, pressing himself to it above the sucking sea. The giggling of the violent people became a loud insulting/negative loudly insult.\n\nJack shouted above the noise.\n\n"You go away, Ralph. You keep to your end. This is my end and my tribe. You leave me alone."\n\nThe jeering died away.\n\n"You pinched Piggy\'s specs," said Ralph, (with difficulty breathing). "You\'ve got to give them back."\n\n"Got to? Who says?"\n\nRalph\'s temper burned/created out.\n\n"I say! You voted for me for chief. Didn\'t you hear the conch? You played a dirty trick--we\'d have given you fire if you\'d asked for it--"\n\nThe blood was flowing in his cheeks and the bunged-up eye beat/hurt a lot.\n\n"You could have had fire whenever you wanted. But you didn\'t. You came sneaking up like a thief and stole Piggy\'s glasses!"\n\n"Say that again!"\n\n"Thief! Thief!\n\nPiggy screamed.\n\n"Ralph! Mind me!"\n\nJack made a rush and stabbed at Ralph\'s chest with spear. Ralph sensed the position of the weapon from the short look he caught of Jack\'s arm and put the thrust aside with his own butt. Then he brought the end round and caught Jack a stinger across the ear. They were chest to chest, breathing extremely strongly, pushing and angrily staring.\n\n"Who\'s a thief?"\n\n"You are!"\n\nJack wrenched free and swung at Ralph with his spear. By agreement from everyone they were using the spears as sabers now, no longer daring the deadly points. The blow struck Ralph\'s spear and slid down, to fall extremely (painfully) on his fingers. Then they were apart once more, their positions reversed, Jack toward the Castle Rock and Ralph on the outside toward the island.\n\n167\n\nBoth boys were breathing very heavily.\n\n"Come on then--"\n\n"Come on--"\n\nHatefully they squared up to each other but kept just out of fighting distance.\n\n"You come on and see what you get!"\n\n"You come on--"\n\nPiggy holding (in hand) the ground was trying to attract Ralph\'s attention. Ralph moved, bent down, kept an aware (and a little nervous) eye on Jack.\n\n"Ralph--remember what we came for. The fire. My specs."\n\nRalph nodded. He relaxed his fighting muscles, stood easily and grounded the butt of his spear. Jack watched him mysteriously through his paint. Ralph quickly looked up at the peaks, then toward the group of violent people.\n\n"Listen. We\'ve come to say this. First you\'ve got to give back Piggy\'s specs. If he hasn\'t got them he can\'t see. You aren\'t playing the game--"\n\nThe tribe of painted violent people giggled and Ralph\'s mind paused (or failed). He pushed his hair up and looked at the green and black mask before him, trying to remember what Jack looked like.\n\nPiggy whispered.\n\n"And the fire."\n\n"Oh yes. Then about the fire. I say this again. I\'ve been saying it ever since we dropped in."\n\nHe held out his spear and pointed at the violent people.\n\n"Your only hope is keeping a signal fire going as long as there\'s light to see. Then maybe a ship\'ll (see/hear/become aware of) the smoke and come and rescue us and take us home. But without that smoke we\'ve got to wait till some ship comes by (sudden unplanned bad event/crash). We might wait years; till we were old--"\n\nThe shaking (from fear or cold), silvery, unreal laughter of the violent people sprayed out and echoed away. A gust of extreme anger shook Ralph. His voice cracked.\n\n"Don\'t you understand, you painted fools? Sam, Eric, Piggy and me--we aren\'t enough. We tried to keep the fire going, but we couldn\'t. And then you, playing at hunting. . . ."\n\nHe pointed past them to where the trickle of smoke broke up and moved away in the pearly air.\n\n"Look at that! Call that a signal fire? That\'s a cooking fire. Now\n\n168\n\nyou\'ll eat and there\'ll be no smoke. Don\'t you understand? There may be a ship out there--"\n\nHe paused, defeated by the silence and the painted (not knowing or telling someone\'s name) of the group guarding the entry. Jack opened a pink mouth and talked to/looked at Samneric, who were between him and his tribe.\n\n"You two. Get back."\n\nNo one answered him. The twins, confused, looked at each other; while Piggy, calmed by the ending of violence, stood up carefully. Jack quickly looked back at Ralph and then at the twins.\n\n"Grab them!"\n\nThe painted group moved round Samneric nervously and unhandily. Once more the silvery laughter scattered.\n\nSamneric protested out of the heart of city/people.\n\n"Oh, I say!"\n\n"--honestly!"\n\nTheir spears were taken from them.\n\n"Tie them up!"\n\nRalph cried out hopelessly against the black and green mask.\n\n"Jack!"\n\n"Go on. Tie them."\n\nNow the painted group felt the otherness of Samneric, felt the power in their own hands. They cut down/destroyed the twins clumsily and excitedly. Jack was intelligent. He knew that Ralph would attempt a rescue. He struck in a humming circle behind him and Ralph only just avoided the blow. Beyond them the tribe and the twins were a loud and wriggling in pain heap. Piggy bent down again. Then the twins lay, surprised and shocked, and the tribe stood round them. Jack turned to Ralph and spoke between his teeth.\n\n"See? They do what I want."\n\nThere was silence again. The twins lay, inexpertly tied up, and the tribe watched Ralph to see what he would do. He numbered them through his fringe, seen/looked the ineffective smoke.\n\nHis temper broke. He screamed at Jack.\n\n"You\'re a beast and a swine and a bloody, bloody thief!"\n\nHe charged.\n\nJack, knowing this was the serious problem, charged too. They met with a jolt and bounced apart. Jack swung with his fist at Ralph and caught him on the ear. Ralph hit Jack in the stomach and made him grunt. Then\n\n169\n\nthey were facing each other again, panting and extremely angry, but made nervous and worried by each other\'s scary strength. They became aware of the noise that was the background to this fight, the steady high-pitched and loud cheering of the tribe behind them.\n\nPiggy\'s voice penetrated to Ralph.\n\n"Let me speak."\n\nHe was standing in the dust of the fight, and as the tribe saw his plan/purpose the high-pitched and loud cheer changed to a steady booing.\n\nPiggy held up the conch and the booing sagged a little, then came up again to strength.\n\n"I got the conch!"\n\nHe shouted.\n\n"I tell you, I got the conch!"\n\nSurprisingly, there was silence now; the tribe were curious to hear what slightly funny thing he might have to say.\n\nSilence and pause; but in the silence a curious air-noise, close by Ralph\'s head. He gave it half his attention--and there it was again; a faint "Zup!" Someone was throwing stones: Roger was dropping them, his one hand still on the lever. Below him, Ralph was a shock of hair and Piggy a bag of fat.\n\n"I got this to say. You\'re acting like a crowd of kids."\n\nThe booing rose and died again as Piggy lifted the white, magic shell.\n\n"Which is better--to be a pack of painted Indians like you are, or to be (reasonable/showing good judgment) like Ralph is?"\n\nA great loud noise/yell rose among the violent people. Piggy shouted again.\n\n"Which is better--to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?"\n\nAgain the loud noise/yell and again--"Zup!"\n\nRalph shouted against the noise.\n\n"Which is better, law and rescue, or hunting and breaking things up?"\n\nNow Jack was yelling too and Ralph could no longer make himself heard. Jack had backed right against the tribe and they were a solid mass of dangerous and threatening thing that got angry with spears. The plan/purpose of a charge was forming among them; they were working up to it and the neck would be swept clear. Ralph stood facing them, a little to one side, his spear ready. By him stood Piggy still holding out the lucky charm, the\n\n170\n\ndelicate and breakable, shining beauty of the shell. The storm of sound beat at them, a magical song of hatred. High overhead, Roger, with a sense of insane (being left alone, with no help), leaned all his weight on the lever.\n\nRalph heard the great rock before he saw it. He knew about a jolt in the earth that came to him through the soles of his feet, and the breaking sound of stones at the top of the cliff. Then the monster-like red thing bounded across the neck and he threw/thrown himself flat while the tribe yelled.\n\nThe rock struck Piggy a hit (that bounced off) from chin to knee; the conch exploded into a thousand white pieces and stopped to exist. Piggy, saying nothing, with no time for even a grunt, traveled through the air sideways from the rock, turning over as he went. The rock bounded twice and was lost in the forest. Piggy fell forty feet and landed on his back across the square red rock in the sea. His head opened and stuff came out and turned red. Piggy\'s arms and legs twitched a bit, like a pig\'s after it has been killed. Then the sea breathed again in a long, slow sigh, the water boiled white and pink over the rock; and when it went, sucking back again, the body of Piggy was gone.\n\nThis time the silence was complete. Ralph\'s lips formed a word but no sound came.\n\nSuddenly Jack bounded out from the tribe and began screaming wildly.\n\n"See? See? That\'s what you\'ll get! I meant that! There isn\'t a tribe for you any more! The conch is gone--"\n\nHe ran forward, bent over.\n\n"I\'m chief!"\n\nIn an evil and violent way, with full plan/purpose, he threw/thrown his spear at Ralph. The point tore the skin and flesh over Ralph\'s ribs, then sheared off and fell in the water. Ralph (tripped while walking/made a mistake), feeling not pain but panic, and the tribe, screaming now like the chief, began to advance. Another spear, a bent one that would not fly straight, went past his face and one fell from on high where Roger was. The twins lay hidden behind the tribe and the unnamed devils\' faces moved in huge numbers across the neck. Ralph turned and ran. A great noise as of sea gulls rose behind him. He exactly follow (orders)ed a gut feeling that he did not know he possessed and (turned from a straight path to avoid something) over the open space so that the spears went wide. He saw the headless body of the\n\n171\n\nplant seed/cause/produce and jumped in time. Then he was crashing through green plants and small branches and was hidden by the forest.\n\nThe chief stopped by the pig, turned and held up his hands.\n\n"Back! Back to the fort!"\n\nNow the tribe returned noisily to the neck where Roger joined them.\n\nThe chief spoke to him angrily.\n\n"Why aren\'t you on watch?"\n\nRoger looked at him very seriously.\n\n"I just came down--"\n\nThe hangman\'s horror clung round him. The chief said no more to him but looked down at Samneric.\n\n"You got to join the tribe."\n\n"You lemme go--"\n\n"--and me."\n\nThe chief grabbed one of the few spears that were left and poked Sam in the ribs.\n\n"What d\'you mean by it, eh?" said the chief extremely strongly. "What d\'you mean by coming with spears? What d\'you mean by not joining my tribe?"\n\nThe poking/encouraging became (like a steady drumbeat). Sam yelled.\n\n"That\'s not the way."\n\nRoger edged past the chief, only just avoiding pushing him with his shoulder. The yelling stopped, and Samneric lay looking up in quiet terror. Roger advanced upon them as one holding a without a name authority.',pe='Ralph lay in a covert, wondering about his wounds. The bruised flesh was inches in diameter over his right ribs, with a swollen and bloody scar where the spear had hit him. His hair was full of dirt and tapped like the tendrils of a creeper. All over he was scratched and bruised from his flight through the forest. By the time his breathing was normal again, he had worked out that bathing these injuries would have to wait. How could you listen for naked feet if you were splashing in water? How could you be safe by the little stream or on the open beach?\n\nRalph listened. He was not really far from the Castle Rock, and during the first panic he had thought he heard sounds of pursuit. But the hunters had only sneaked into the fringes of the greenery, retrieving spears perhaps, and then had rushed back to the sunny rock as if terrified of the darkness under the leaves. He had even glimpsed one of them, striped brown, black, and red, and had judged that it was Bill. But really, thought Ralph, this was not Bill. This was a savage whose image refused to blend with that ancient picture of a boy in shorts and shirt.\n\nThe afternoon died away; the circular spots of sunlight moved steadily over green fronds and brown fiber but no sound came from behind the rock. At last Ralph wormed out of the ferns and sneaked forward to the edge of that impenetrable thicket that fronted the neck of land. He peered with elaborate caution between branches at the edge and could see Robert sitting on guard at the top of the cliff. He held a spear in his left hand and was tossing up a pebble and catching it again with the right. Behind him a column of smoke rose thickly, so that Ralph\'s nostrils flared and his mouth dribbled. He wiped his nose and mouth with the back of his hand and for the first time since the morning felt hungry. The tribe must be sitting round the gutted pig, watching the fat ooze and burn among the ashes. They would be intent.\n\nAnother figure, an unrecognizable one, appeared by Robert and gave him something, then turned and went back behind the rock. Robert laid his spear on the rock beside him and began to gnaw between his raised hands. So the feast was beginning and the watchman had been given his portion.\n\nRalph saw that for the time being he was safe. He limped away through the fruit trees, drawn by the thought of the poor food yet bitter when he remembered the feast. Feast today, and then tomorrow. . . .\n\nHe argued unconvincingly that they would let him alone, perhaps even make an outlaw of him. But then the fatal unreasoning knowledge came to him again. The breaking of the conch and the deaths of Piggy and Simon lay over the island like a vapor. These painted savages would go further and further. Then there was that indefinable connection between himself and Jack; who therefore would never let him alone; never.\n\nHe paused, sun-flecked, holding up a bough, prepared to duck under it. A spasm of terror set him shaking and he cried aloud.\n\n"No. They\'re not as bad as that. It was an accident."\n\nHe ducked under the bough, ran clumsily, then stopped and listened.\n\nHe came to the smashed acres of fruit and ate greedily. He saw two littluns and, not having any idea of his own appearance, wondered why they screamed and ran.\n\nWhen he had eaten he went toward the beach. The sunlight was slanting now into the palms by the wrecked shelter. There was the platform and the pool. The best thing to do was to ignore this leaden feeling about the heart and rely on their common sense, their daylight sanity. Now that the tribe had eaten, the thing to do was to try again. And anyway, he couldn\'t stay here all night in an empty shelter by the deserted platform. His flesh crept and he shivered in the evening sun. No fire; no smoke; no rescue. He turned and limped away through the forest toward Jack\'s end of the island.\n\nThe slanting sticks of sunlight were lost among the branches. At length he came to a clearing in the forest where rock prevented vegetation from growing. Now it was a pool of shadows and Ralph nearly flung himself behind a tree when he saw something standing in the center; but then he saw that the white face was bone and that the pig\'s skull grinned at him from the top of a stick. He walked slowly into the middle of the clearing and looked steadily at the skull that gleamed as white as ever the conch had done and seemed to jeer at him cynically. An inquisitive ant was busy in one of the eye sockets but otherwise the thing was lifeless.\nOr was it?\n\nLittle prickles of sensation ran up and down his back. He stood, the skull about on a level with his face, and held up his hair with two hands. The teeth grinned, the empty sockets seemed to hold his gaze masterfully and without effort.\n\n\nWhat was it?\n\nThe skull regarded Ralph like one who knows all the answers and won\'t tell. A sick fear and rage swept him. Fiercely he hit out at the filthy thing in front of him that bobbed like a toy and came back, still grinning into his face, so that he lashed and cried out in loathing. Then he was licking his bruised knuckles and looking at the bare stick, while the skull lay in two pieces, its grin now six feet across. He wrenched the quivering stick from the crack and held it as a spear between him and the white pieces. Then he backed away, keeping his face to the skull that lay grinning at the sky.\n\nWhen the green glow had gone from the horizon and night was fully accomplished, Ralph came again to the thicket in front of the Castle Rock. Peeping through, he could see that the height was still occupied, and whoever it was up there had a spear at the ready.\n\nHe knelt among the shadows and felt his isolation bitterly. They were savages it was true; but they were human, and the ambushing fears of the deep night were coming on.\nRalph moaned faintly. Tired though he was, he could not relax and fall into a well of sleep for fear of the tribe. Might it not be possible to walk boldly into the fort, say-- "I\'ve got pax," laugh lightly and sleep among the others? Pretend they were still boys, schoolboys who had said, "Sir, yes, Sir"--and worn caps? Daylight might have answered yes; but darkness and the horrors of death said no. Lying there in the darkness, he knew he was an outcast.\n\n" \'Cos I had some sense."\n\nHe rubbed his cheek along his forearm, smelling the acrid scent of salt and sweat and the staleness of dirt. Over to the left, the waves of ocean were breathing, sucking down, then boiling back over the rock.\n\nThere were sounds coming from behind the Castle Rock. Listening carefully, detaching his mind from the swing of the sea, Ralph could make out a familiar rhythm.\n\n"_Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!_"\n\nThe tribe was dancing. Somewhere on the other side of this rocky wall there would be a dark circle, a glowing fire, and meat. They would be savoring food and the comfort of safety.\n\nA noise nearer at hand made him quiver. Savages were clambering up the Castle Rock, right up to the top, and he could hear voices. He sneaked forward a few yards and saw the shape at the top of the rock change and enlarge. There were only two boys on the island who moved or talked like that.\n\nRalph put his head down on his forearms and accepted this new fact like a wound. Samneric were part of the tribe now. They were guarding the Castle Rock against him. There was no chance of rescuing them and building up an outlaw tribe at the other end of the island. Samneric were savages like the rest; Piggy was dead, and the conch smashed to powder.\n\nAt length the guard climbed down. The two that remained seemed nothing more than a dark extension of the rock. A star appeared behind them and was momentarily eclipsed by some movement.\nRalph edged forward, feeling his way over the uneven surface as though he were blind. There were miles of vague water at his right and the restless ocean lay under his left hand, as awful as the shaft of a pit. Every minute the water breathed round the death rock and flowered into a field of whiteness. Ralph crawled until he found the ledge of the entry in his grasp. The lookouts were immediately above him and he could see the end of a spear projecting over the rock.\n\nHe called very gently.\n\n"Samneric--"\n\nThere was no reply. To carry he must speak louder; and this would rouse those striped and inimical creatures from their feasting by the fire. He set his teeth and started to climb, finding the holds by touch. The stick that had supported a skull hampered him but he would not be parted from his only weapon. He was nearly level with the twins before he spoke again.\n\n"Samneric--"\n\nHe heard a cry and a flurry from the rock. The twins had grabbed each other and were gibbering.\n\n"It\'s me. Ralph."\n\nTerrified that they would run and give the alarm, he hauled himself up until his head and shoulders stuck over the top. Far below his armpit he saw the luminous flowering round the rock.\n\n"It\'s only me. Ralph."\n\nAt length they bent forward and peered in his face.\n\n"We thought it was--"\n\n"--we didn\'t know what it was--"\n\n"--we thought--"\n\nMemory of their new and shameful loyalty came to them. Eric was silent but Sam tried to do his duty.\n\n\n"You got to go, Ralph. You go away now--"\n\nHe wagged his spear and essayed fierceness.\n\n"You shove off. See?"\n\nEric nodded agreement and jabbed his spear in the air. Ralph leaned on his arms and did not go.\n\n"I came to see you two."\n\nHis voice was thick. His throat was hurting him now though it had received no wound.\n\n"I came to see you two--"\n\nWords could not express the dull pain of these things. He fell silent, while the vivid stars were spilt and danced all ways.\nSam shifted uneasily.\n\n"Honest, Ralph, you\'d better go."\n\nRalph looked up again.\n\n"You two aren\'t painted. How can you--? If it were light--"\n\nIf it were light shame would burn them at admitting these things. But the night was dark. Eric took up; and then the twins started their antiphonal speech.\n\n"You got to go because it\'s not safe--"\n\n"--they made us. They hurt us--"\n\n"Who? Jack?"\n\n"Oh no--"\n\nThey bent to him and lowered their voices.\n\n"Push off, Ralph--"\n\n"--it\'s a tribe--"\n\n"--they made us--"\n\n"--we couldn\'t help it--"\n\nWhen Ralph spoke again his voice was low, and seemed breathless.\n\n"What have I done? I liked him--and I wanted us to be rescued--"\nAgain the stars spilled about the sky. Eric shook his head, earnestly.\n\n"Listen, Ralph. Never mind what\'s sense. That\'s gone--"\n\n"Never mind about the chief--"\n\n"--you got to go for your own good."\n\n"The chief and Roger--"\n\n"--yes, Roger--"\n\n"They hate you, Ralph. They\'re going to do you."\n\n"They\'re going to hunt you tomorrow."\n\n"But why?"\n\n"I dunno. And Ralph, Jack, the chief, says it\'ll be dangerous--"\n\n"--and we\'ve got to be careful and throw our spears like at a pig."\n"We\'re going to spread out in a line across the island--"\n\n"--we\'re going forward from this end--"\n\n"--until we find you."\n\n"We\'ve got to give signals like this."\n\nEric raised his head and achieved a faint ululation by beating on his open mouth. Then he glanced behind him nervously.\n\n"Like that--"\n\n"--only louder, of course."\n\n"But I\'ve done nothing," whispered Ralph, urgently. "I only wanted to keep up a fire!"\n\nHe paused for a moment, thinking miserably of the morrow. A matter of overwhelming importance occurred to him.\n"What are you--?"\n\nHe could not bring himself to be specific at first; but then fear and loneliness goaded him.\n\n"When they find me, what are they going to do?"\n\nThe twins were silent. Beneath him, the death rock flowered again.\n\n"What are they--oh God! I\'m hungry--"\n\nThe towering rock seemed to sway under him.\n\n"Well--what--?"\n\nThe twins answered his question indirectly.\n\n"You got to go now, Ralph."\n\n"For your own good."\n\n"Keep away. As far as you can."\n\n"Won\'t you come with me? Three of us--we\'d stand a chance."\n\nAfter a moment\'s silence, Sam spoke in a strangled voice.\n\n"You don\'t know Roger. He\'s a terror."\n\n"And the chief--they\'re both--"\n\n"--terrors--"\n\n"--only Roger--"\n\nBoth boys froze. Someone was climbing toward them from the tribe.\n\n"He\'s coming to see if we\'re keeping watch. Quick, Ralph!"\nAs he prepared to let himself down the cliff, Ralph snatched at the last possible advantage to be wrung out of this meeting.\n\n"I\'ll lie up close; in that thicket down there," he whispered, "so keep them away from it. They\'ll never think to look so close--"\n\nThe footsteps were still some distance away.\n\n"Sam--I\'m going to be all right, aren\'t I?"\n\nThe twins were silent again.\n\n"Here!" said Sam suddenly. "Take this--"\n\nRalph felt a chunk of meat pushed against him and grabbed it.\n\n"But what are you going to do when you catch me?"\n\nSilence above. He sounded silly to himself. He lowered himself down the rock.\n\n"What are you going to do--?"\n\nFrom the top of the towering rock came the incomprehensible reply.\n\n"Roger sharpened a stick at both ends."\n\nRoger sharpened a stick at both ends. Ralph tried to attach a meaning to this but could not. He used all the bad words he could think of in a fit of temper that passed into yawning. How long could you go without sleep? He yearned for a bed and sheets--but the only whiteness here was the slow spilt milk, luminous round the rock forty feet below, where Piggy had fallen. Piggy was everywhere, was on this neck, was become terrible in darkness and death. If Piggy were to come back now out of the water, with his empty head--Ralph whimpered and yawned like a littlun. The stick in his hand became a crutch on which he reeled.\n\nThen he tensed again. There were voices raised on the top of the Castle Rock. Samneric were arguing with someone. But the ferns and the grass were near. That was the place to be in, hidden, and next to the thicket that would serve for tomorrow\'s hideout. Here--and his hands touched grass--was a place to be in for the night, not far from the tribe, so that if the horrors of the supernatural emerged one could at least mix with humans for the time being, even if it meant . . .\n\nWhat did it mean? A stick sharpened at both ends. What was there in that? They had thrown spears and missed; all but one. Perhaps they would miss next time, too.\n\nHe squatted down in the tall grass, remembered the meat that Sam had given him, and began to tear at it ravenously. While he was eating, he heard fresh noises--cries of pain from Samneric, cries of panic, angry voices. What did it mean? Someone besides himself was in trouble, for at least one of the twins was catching it. Then the voices passed away down the rock and he ceased to think of them. He felt with his hands and found cool, delicate fronds backed against the thicket. Here then was the night\'s lair. At first light he would creep into the thicket, squeeze between the twisted stems, ensconce himself so deep that only a crawler like himself could come through, and that crawler would be jabbed. There he would sit, and the search would pass him by, and the cordon waver on, ululating along the island, and he would be free.\n\nHe pulled himself between the ferns, tunneling in. He laid the stick beside him, and huddled himself down in the blackness. One must remember to wake at first light, in order to diddle the savages--and he did not know how quickly sleep came and hurled him down a dark interior slope.\n\nHe was awake before his eyes were open, listening to a noise that was near. He opened an eye, found the mold an inch or so from his face and his fingers gripped into it, light filtering between the fronds of fern. He had just time to realize that the age-long nightmares of falling and death were past and that the morning was come, when he heard the sound again. It was an ululation over by the seashore-- and now the next savage answered and the next. The cry swept by him across the narrow end of the island from sea to lagoon, like the cry of a flying bird. He took no time to consider but grabbed his sharp stick and wriggled back among the ferns. Within seconds he was worming his way into the thicket; but not before he had glimpsed the legs of a savage coming toward him. The ferns were thumped and beaten and he heard legs moving in the long grass. The savage, whoever he was, ululated twice; and the cry was repeated in both directions, then died away. Ralph crouched still, tangled in the ferns, and for a time he heard nothing.\n\nAt last he examined the thicket itself. Certainly no one could attack him here--and moreover he had a stroke of luck. The great rock that had killed Piggy had bounded into this thicket and bounced there, right in the center, making a smashed space a few feet in extent each way. When Ralph had wriggled into this he felt secure, and clever. He sat down carefully among the smashed stems and waited for the hunt to pass. Looking up between the leaves he caught a glimpse of something red. That must be the top of the Castle Rock, distant and unmenacing. He composed himself triumphantly, to hear the sounds of the hunt dying away.\n\nYet no one made a sound; and as the minutes passed, in the green shade, his feeling of triumph faded.\n\nAt last he heard a voice--Jack\'s voice, but hushed.\n\n"Are you certain?"\n\nThe savage addressed said nothing. Perhaps he made a gesture.\n\nRoger spoke.\n\n"If you\'re fooling us--"\n\nImmediately after this, there came a gasp, and a squeal of pain.\n\nRalph crouched instinctively. One of the twins was there, outside the thicket, with Jack and Roger.\n\n"You\'re sure he meant in there?"\n\nThe twin moaned faintly and then squealed again.\n\n"He meant he\'d hide in there?"\n\n"Yes--yes--oh--!"\n\nSilver laughter scattered among the trees.\n\nSo they knew.\n\nRalph picked up his stick and prepared for battle. But what could they do? It would take them a week to break a path through the thicket; and anyone who wormed his way in would be helpless. He felt the point of his spear with his thumb and grinned without amusement. Whoever tried that would be stuck, squealing like a pig.\n\nThey were going away, back to the tower rock. He could hear feet moving and then someone sniggered. There came again that high, bird-like cry that swept along the line. So some were still watching for him; but some--?\n\nThere was a long, breathless silence. Ralph found that he had bark in his mouth from the gnawed spear. He stood and peered upwards to the Castle Rock.\n\nAs he did so, he heard Jack\'s voice from the top.\n\n"Heave! Heave! Heave!"\n\nThe red rock that he could see at the top of the cliff vanished like a curtain, and he could see figures and blue sky. A moment later the earth jolted, there was a rushing sound in the air, and the top of the thicket was cuffed as with a gigantic hand. The rock bounded on, thumping and smashing toward the beach, while a shower of broken twigs and leaves fell on him. Beyond the thicket, the tribe was cheering.\n\nSilence again.\n\nRalph put his fingers in his mouth and bit them. There was only one other rock up there that they might conceivably move; but that was half as big as a cottage, big as a car, a tank. He visualized its probable progress with agonizing clearness--that one would start slowly, drop from ledge to ledge, trundle across the neck like an outsize steamroller.\n\n"Heave! Heave! Heave!"\n\nRalph put down his spear, then picked it up again. He pushed his hair back irritably, took two hasty steps across the little space and then came back. He stood looking at the broken ends of branches.\nStill silence.\n\nHe caught sight of the rise and fall of his diaphragm and was surprised to see how quickly he was breathing. Just left of center his heart-beats were visible. He put the spear down again.\n\n"Heave! Heave! Heave!"\n\nA shrill, prolonged cheer.\n\nSomething boomed up on the red rock, then the earth jumped and began to shake steadily, while the noise as steadily increased. Ralph was shot into the air, thrown down, dashed against branches. At his right hand, and only a few feet away, the whole thicket bent and the roots screamed as they came out of the earth together. He saw something red that turned over slowly as a mill wheel. Then the red thing was past and the elephantine progress diminished toward the sea.\n\nRalph knelt on the plowed-up soil, and waited for the earth to come back. Presently the white, broken stumps, the split sticks and the tangle of the thicket refocused. There was a kind of heavy feeling in his body where he had watched his own pulse.\nSilence again.\n\nYet not entirely so. They were whispering out there; and suddenly the branches were shaken furiously at two places on his right. The pointed end of a stick appeared. In panic, Ralph thrust his own stick through the crack and struck with all his might.\n\n"Aaa-ah!"\n\nHis spear twisted a little in his hands and then he withdrew it again.\n\n"Ooh-ooh--"\n\nSomeone was moaning outside and a babble of voices rose. A fierce argument was going on and the wounded savage kept groaning. Then when there was silence, a single voice spoke and Ralph decided that it was not Jack\'s.\n\n"See? I told you--he\'s dangerous."\n\nThe wounded savage moaned again.\n\nWhat else? What next?\n\nRalph fastened his hands round the chewed spear and his hair fell. Someone was muttering, only a few yards away toward the Castle Rock. He heard a savage say "No!" in a shocked voice; and then there was suppressed laughter. He squatted back on his heels and showed his teeth at the wall of branches. He raised his spear, snarled a little, and waited.\n\nOnce more the invisible group sniggered. He heard a curious trickling sound and then a louder crepitation as if someone were unwrapping great sheets of cellophane. A stick snapped and he stifled a cough. Smoke was seeping through the branches in white and yellow wisps, the patch of blue sky overhead turned to the color of a storm cloud, and then the smoke billowed round him.\nSomeone laughed excitedly, and a voice shouted.\n\n"Smoke!"\n\nHe wormed his way through the thicket toward the forest, keeping as far as possible beneath the smoke. Presently he saw open space, and the green leaves of the edge of the thicket. A smallish savage was standing between him and the rest of the forest, a savage striped red and white, and carrying a spear. He was coughing and smearing the paint about his eyes with the back of his hand as he tried to see through the increasing smoke. Ralph launched himself like a cat; stabbed, snarling, with the spear, and the savage doubled up. There was a shout from beyond the thicket and then Ralph was running with the swiftness of fear through the undergrowth. He came to a pig-run, followed it for perhaps a hundred yards, and then swerved off. Behind him the ululation swept across the island once more and a single voice shouted three times. He guessed that was the signal to advance and sped away again, till his chest was like fire. Then he flung himself down under a bush and waited for a moment till his breathing steadied. He passed his tongue tentatively over his teeth and lips and heard far off the ululation of the pursuers.\n\nThere were many things he could do. He could climb a tree; but that was putting all his eggs in one basket. If he were detected, they had nothing more difficult to do than wait.\n\nIf only one had time to think!\n\nAnother double cry at the same distance gave him a clue to their plan. Any savage balked in the forest would utter the double shout and hold up the line till he was free again. That way they might hope to keep the cordon unbroken right across the island. Ralph thought of the boar that had broken through them with such ease. If necessary, when the chase came too close, he could charge the cordon while it was still thin, burst through, and run back. But run back where? The cordon would turn and sweep again. Sooner or later he would have to sleep or eat--and then he would awaken with hands clawing at him; and the hunt would become a running down.\n\nWhat was to be done, then? The tree? Burst the line like a boar?\n\nEither way the choice was terrible.\n\nA single cry quickened his heart-beat and, leaping up, he dashed away toward the ocean side and the thick jungle till he was hung up among creepers; he stayed there for a moment with his calves quivering. If only one could have quiet, a long pause, a time to think!\n\nAnd there again, shrill and inevitable, was the ululation sweeping across the island. At that sound he shied like a horse among the creepers and ran once more till he was panting. He flung himself down by some ferns. The tree, or the charge? He mastered his breathing for a moment, wiped his mouth, and told himself to be calm. Samneric were somewhere in that line, and hating it. Or were they? And supposing, instead of them, he met the chief, or Roger who carried death in his hands?\n\nRalph pushed back his tangled hair and wiped the sweat out of his best eye. He spoke aloud.\n\n"Think."\n\nWhat was the sensible thing to do?\n\nThere was no Piggy to talk sense. There was no solemn assembly for debate nor dignity of the conch.\n\n"Think."\n\nMost, he was beginning to dread the curtain that might waver in his brain, blacking out the sense of danger, making a simpleton of him.\n\nA third idea would be to hide so well that the advancing line would pass without discovering him.\n\nHe jerked his head off the ground and listened. There was another noise to attend to now, a deep grumbling noise, as though the forest itself were angry with him, a somber noise across which the ululations were scribbled excruciatingly as on slate. He knew he had heard it before somewhere, but had no time to remember.\n\nBreak the line.\n\nA tree.\n\nHide, and let them pass.\n\nA nearer cry stood him on his feet and immediately he was away again, running fast among thorns and brambles. Suddenly he blundered into the open, found himself again in that open space--and there was the fathom-wide grin of the skull, no longer ridiculing a deep blue patch of sky but jeering up into a blanket of smoke. Then Ralph was running beneath trees, with the grumble of the forest explained. They had smoked him out and set the island on fire.\n\nHide was better than a tree because you had a chance of breaking the line if you were discovered.\n\nHide, then.\n\nHe wondered if a pig would agree, and grimaced at nothing. Find the deepest thicket, the darkest hole on the island, and creep in. Now, as he ran, he peered about him. Bars and splashes of sunlight flitted over him and sweat made glistening streaks on his dirty body. The cries were far now, and faint.\n\nAt last he found what seemed to him the right place, though the decision was desperate. Here, bushes and a wild tangle of creeper made a mat that kept out all the light of the sun. Beneath it was a space, perhaps a foot high, though it was pierced everywhere by parallel and rising stems. If you wormed into the middle of that you would be five yards from the edge, and hidden, unless the savage chose to lie down and look for you; and even then, you would be in darkness--and if the worst happened and he saw you, then you had a chance to burst out at him, fling the whole line out of step and double back.\n\nCautiously, his stick trailing behind him, Ralph wormed between the rising stems. When he reached the middle of the mat he lay and listened.\n\nThe fire was a big one and the drum-roll that he had thought was left so far behind was nearer. Couldn\'t a fire outrun a galloping horse? He could see the sun-splashed ground over an area of perhaps fifty yards from where he lay, and as he watched, the sunlight in every patch blinked at him. This was so like the curtain that flapped in his brain that for a moment he thought the blinking was inside him. But then the patches blinked more rapidly, dulled and went out, so that he saw that a great heaviness of smoke lay between the island and the sun.\n\nIf anyone peered under the bushes and chanced to glimpse human flesh it might be Samneric who would pretend not to see and say nothing. He laid his cheek against the chocolate-colored earth, licked his dry lips and closed his eyes. Under the thicket, the earth was vibrating very slightly; or perhaps there was a sound beneath the obvious thunder of the fire and scribbled ululations that was too low to hear.\n\nSomeone cried out. Ralph jerked his cheek off the earth and looked into the dulled light. They must be near now, he thought, and his chest began to thump. Hide, break the line, climb a tree--which was the best after all? The trouble was you only had one chance.\n\nNow the fire was nearer; those volleying shots were great limbs, trunks even, bursting. The fools! The fools! The fire must be almost at the fruit trees--what would they eat tomorrow?\n\nRalph stirred restlessly in his narrow bed. One chanced nothing! What could they do? Beat him? So what? Kill him? A stick sharpened at both ends.\n\nThe cries, suddenly nearer, jerked him up. He could see a striped savage moving hastily out of a green tangle, and coming toward the mat where he hid, a savage who carried a spear. Ralph gripped his fingers into the earth. Be ready now, in case.\n\nRalph fumbled to hold his spear so that it was point foremost; and now he saw that the stick was sharpened at both ends.\n\nThe savage stopped fifteen yards away and uttered his cry.\nPerhaps he can hear my heart over the noises of the fire. Don\'t scream. Get ready.\n\nThe savage moved forward so that you could only see him from the waist down. That was the butt of his spear. Now you could see him from the knee down. Don\'t scream.\n\nA herd of pigs came squealing out of the greenery behind the savage and rushed away into the forest. Birds were screaming, mice shrieking, and a little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered.\n\nFive yards away the savage stopped, standing right by the thicket, and cried out. Ralph drew his feet up and crouched. The stake was in his hands, the stake sharpened at both ends, the stake that vibrated so wildly, that grew long, short, light, heavy, light again.\nThe ululation spread from shore to shore. The savage knelt down by the edge of the thicket, and there were lights flickering in the forest behind him. You could see a knee disturb the mold. Now the other. Two hands. A spear.\n\nA face.\n\nThe savage peered into the obscurity beneath the thicket. You could tell that he saw light on this side and on that, but not in the middle--there. In the middle was a blob of dark and the savage wrinkled up his face, trying to decipher the darkness.\n\nThe seconds lengthened. Ralph was looking straight into the savage\'s eyes.\n\nDon\'t scream.\n\nYou\'ll get back.\n\nNow he\'s seen you. He\'s making sure. A stick sharpened.\n\nRalph screamed, a scream of fright and anger and desperation. His legs straightened, the screams became continuous and foaming. He shot forward, burst the thicket, was in the open, screaming, snarling, bloody. He swung the stake and the savage tumbled over; but there were others coming toward him, crying out. He swerved as a spear flew past and then was silent, running. All at once the lights flickering ahead of him merged together, the roar of the forest rose to thunder and a tall bush directly in his path burst into a great fan-shaped flame. He swung to the right, running desperately fast, with the heat beating on his left side and the fire racing forward like a tide. The ululation rose behind him and spread along, a series of short sharp cries, the sighting call. A brown figure showed up at his right and fell away. They were all running, all crying out madly. He could hear them crashing in the undergrowth and on the left was the hot, bright thunder of the fire. He forgot his wounds, his hunger and thirst, and became fear; hopeless fear on flying feet, rushing through the forest toward the open beach. Spots jumped before his eyes and turned into red circles that expanded quickly till they passed out of sight. Below him someone\'s legs were getting tired and the desperate ululation advanced like a jagged fringe of menace and was almost overhead.\n\nHe stumbled over a root and the cry that pursued him rose even higher. He saw a shelter burst into flames and the fire flapped at his right shoulder and there was the glitter of water. Then he was down, rolling over and over in the warm sand, crouching with arm to ward off, trying to cry for mercy.\n\nHe staggered to his feet, tensed for more terrors, and looked up at a huge peaked cap. It was a white-topped cap, and above the green shade of the peak was a crown, an anchor, gold foliage. He saw white drill, epaulettes, a revolver, a row of gilt buttons down the front of a uniform.\n\nA naval officer stood on the sand, looking down at Ralph in wary astonishment. On the beach behind him was a cutter, her bows hauled up and held by two ratings. In the stern-sheets another rating held a sub-machine gun.\n\nThe ululation faltered and died away.\n\nThe officer looked at Ralph doubtfully for a moment, then took his hand away from the butt of the revolver.\n\n"Hullo."\n\nSquirming a little, conscious of his filthy appearance, Ralph answered shyly.\n\n"Hullo."\n\nThe officer nodded, as if a question had been answered.\n\n"Are there any adults--any grownups with you?"\n\nDumbly, Ralph shook his head. He turned a halfpace on the sand. A semicircle of little boys, their bodies streaked with colored clay, sharp sticks in their hands, were standing on the beach making no noise at all.\n\n"Fun and games," said the officer.\n\nThe fire reached the coconut palms by the beach and swallowed them noisily. A flame, seemingly detached, swung like an acrobat and licked up the palm heads on the platform. The sky was black.\nThe officer grinned cheerfully at Ralph.\n\n"We saw your smoke. What have you been doing? Having a war or something?"\n\nRalph nodded.\n\nThe officer inspected the little scarecrow in front of him. The kid needed a bath, a haircut, a nose-wipe and a good deal of ointment.\n\n"Nobody killed, I hope? Any dead bodies?"\n\n"Only two. And they\'ve gone."\n\nThe officer leaned down and looked closely at Ralph.\n\n"Two? Killed?"\n\nRalph nodded again. Behind him, the whole island was shuddering with flame. The officer knew, as a rule, when people were telling the truth. He whistled softly.\n\nOther boys were appearing now, tiny tots some of them, brown, with the distended bellies of small savages. One of them came close to the officer and looked up.\n\n"I\'m, I\'m--"\n\nBut there was no more to come. Percival Wemys Madison sought in his head for an incantation that had faded clean away.\n\nThe officer turned back to Ralph.\n\n"We\'ll take you off. How many of you are there?"\n\nRalph shook his head. The officer looked past him to the group of painted boys.\n\n"Who\'s boss here?"\n\n"I am," said Ralph loudly.\n\nA little boy who wore the remains of an extraordinary black cap on his red hair and who carried the remains of a pair of spectacles at his waist, started forward, then changed his mind and stood still.\n\n"We saw your smoke. And you don\'t know how many of you there are?"\n\n"No, sir."\n\n"I should have thought," said the officer as he visualized the search before him, "I should have thought that a pack of British boys--you\'re all British, aren\'t you?--would have been able to put up a better show than that--I mean--"\n\n"It was like that at first," said Ralph, "before things--"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n"We were together then--"\n\nThe officer nodded helpfully.\n\n"I know. Jolly good show. Like the Coral Island."\n\nRalph looked at him dumbly. For a moment he had a fleeting picture of the strange glamour that had once invested the beaches. But the island was scorched up like dead wood--Simon was dead--and Jack had. . . . The tears began to flow and sobs shook him. He gave himself up to them now for the first time on the island; great, shuddering spasms of grief that seemed to wrench his whole body. His voice rose under the black smoke before the burning wreckage of the island; and infected by that emotion, the other little boys began to shake and sob too. And in the middle of them, with filthy body, matted hair, and unwiped nose, Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man\'s heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.\n\nThe officer, surrounded by these noises, was moved and a little embarrassed. He turned away to give them time to pull themselves together; and waited, allowing his eyes to rest on the trim cruiser in the distance.',ye="https://ogreenwood672.github.io/website/#/";function be(e){return r.a.createElement("button",{className:"navbutton",onClick:function(){e.onClick()}},e.value)}var ke=function(e){Object(h.a)(n,e);var t=Object(i.a)(n);function n(){return Object(a.a)(this,n),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(n,[{key:"handleClick",value:function(e){window.location.href="HOME"!==e?ye+e.toLowerCase():ye}},{key:"renderButton",value:function(e){var t=this;return r.a.createElement(be,{value:e,onClick:function(){return t.handleClick(e)}})}},{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"navbar"},r.a.createElement("div",{className:"leftNavbar"},this.renderButton("HOME"),this.renderButton("About")))}}]),n}(r.a.Component),ve=function(e){Object(h.a)(n,e);var t=Object(i.a)(n);function n(){return Object(a.a)(this,n),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(n,[{key:"render",value:function(){var e=ye;return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"rightProjects"},r.a.createElement("div",{className:"dropdown"},r.a.createElement("button",{className:"navbutton"},"Algorithms"),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"dropdown-content"},r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"chess"},"Chess"),r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"sudoku"},"Sudoku"),r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"noughts_and_crosses"},"Noughts and Crosses"),r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"maze_generator"},"Maze Generator"),r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"maze_solver"},"Maze Solver"))),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"dropdown"},r.a.createElement("button",{className:"navbutton"},"Games"),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"dropdown-content"},r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"snake"},"Snake"),r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"conways_game_of_life"},"Conway's Game of Life"))),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"dropdown"},r.a.createElement("button",{className:"navbutton"},"Text Based"),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"dropdown-content"},r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"password_checker"},"Password Checker"),r.a.createElement("a",{href:e+"lord_of_the_flies"},"LofTF"))))}}]),n}(r.a.Component),Te=function(e){Object(h.a)(n,e);var t=Object(i.a)(n);function n(){return Object(a.a)(this,n),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(n,[{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"mainBox center"},r.a.createElement("h1",null,"<Insert inspirational quote here>"))}}]),n}(r.a.Component),Re=function(e){Object(h.a)(n,e);var t=Object(i.a)(n);function n(){return Object(a.a)(this,n),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(n,[{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"mainBox center"},r.a.createElement("h1",null,"Good Afternoon"))}}]),n}(r.a.Component),He=function(e){Object(h.a)(n,e);var t=Object(i.a)(n);function n(){return Object(a.a)(this,n),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(n,[{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement(u.a,null,r.a.createElement("div",{className:"background"},r.a.createElement(ke,null),r.a.createElement(ve,null),r.a.createElement(c.c,null,r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/lord_of_the_flies"},r.a.createElement(he,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/password_checker"},r.a.createElement(w,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/noughts_and_crosses"},r.a.createElement(k,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/sudoku"},r.a.createElement(H,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/maze_generator"},r.a.createElement(A,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/snake"},r.a.createElement(Y,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/conways_game_of_life"},r.a.createElement(q,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/maze_solver"},r.a.createElement(F,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/chess"},r.a.createElement(ae,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/about"},r.a.createElement(Te,null)),r.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/"},r.a.createElement(Re,null)))))}}]),n}(r.a.Component);l.a.render(r.a.createElement(He,null),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[25,1,2]]]);
